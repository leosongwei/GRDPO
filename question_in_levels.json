Then \\( 3^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\) and \\( 5^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\) because any even power of an odd number is congruent to 1 modulo 4. Therefore, \\( 3^k + 5^k \\equiv 1 + 1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4} \\). However, 2 modulo 4 cannot be a power of an integer with an exponent greater than 1, as it would either have too many or too few factors of 2. Thus, \\( k \\) must be odd.\n\n2. **Consider \\( k \\) modulo 16**:\n   - Since \\( k \\) is odd, we need to check \\( 3^k + 5^k \\pmod{16} \\). For odd \\( k \\), \\( 3^k \\equiv 3 \\pmod{16} \\) and \\( 5^k \\equiv 5 \\pmod{16} \\). Therefore, \\( 3^k + 5^k \\equiv 3 + 5 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{16} \\). This implies that \\( 3^k + 5^k \\) must be a power of 2, specifically \\( 2^3 = 8 \\).

Thus, \\( k = 1 \\) works.\n\n4. **Assume \\( k > 1 \\)**:\n   - Since \\( k \\) is odd, we need to check higher values of \\( k \\).\n\n5. **Consider \\( k \\) modulo 9**:\n   - For \\( k \\) to be a cube, \\( 3^k + 5^k \\) modulo 9 must be \\( -1, 0, \\) or \\( 1 \\). Since \\( k \\) is odd, \\( 3^k \\equiv 3 \\pmod{9} \\) and \\( 5^k \\equiv 5 \\pmod{9} \\). Therefore, \\( 3^k + 5^k \\equiv 3 + 5 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{9} \\).

Therefore, among $A, B, C, D$, there is one point such that the midpoint of the line segment connecting it to $P$ is a point in $S$, hence $n \\leqslant 3$.\n\nOn the other hand, we prove: for any three points $A, B, C$ in $S$, there exists another point $P$ in $S$ such that the interiors of $A P, B P, C P$ do not contain any integer points.\n\nNote that for integer points $X\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ and $Y\\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\\right)$ on the plane, the necessary and sufficient condition for the line segment $X Y$ to have no integer points in its interior is $\\left(x_{1}-x_{2}, y_{1}-y_{2}\\right)=1$.

From the first equation, solve for \\( m \\):\n   \\[\n   m^2 = \\frac{a}{d} \\implies m = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{d}}\n   \\]\n8. Let \\( m_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{d}} \\) and \\( m_2 = -\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{d}} \\). These are the two possible values for \\( m \\).\n9. For each \\( m \\), solve for \\( n \\) using the second equation:\n   \\[\n   b = 2dmn + em \\implies b = m(2dn + e)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   n = \\frac{b - em}{2dm}\n   \\]\n10. Substituting \\( m_1 \\) and \\( m_2 \\) into the equation for \\( n \\):\n    \\[\n    n_1 = \\frac{b - e\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{d}}}{2d\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{d}}} = \\frac{b - e\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{d}}}{2\\sqrt{ad}}\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    n_2 = \\frac{b + e\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{d}}}{-2d\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{d}}} = \\frac{b + e\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{d}}}{-2\\sqrt{ad}}\n    \\]\n11. Therefore, the two linear functions \\( \\ell(x) \\) are:\n    \\[\n    \\ell_1(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{d}}x + \\frac{b - e\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{d}}}{2\\sqrt{ad}}\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    \\ell_2(x) = -\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{d}}x + \\frac{b + e\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{d}}}{-2\\sqrt{ad}}\n    \\]\n\nConclusion:\nThere are exactly two such linear functions \\( \\ell(x) \\) that satisfy the given condition.\n\nThe final answer is \\( \\boxed{2} \\)"

The area of the rectangle is cut in half by its diagonal passing through $(0,0)$ and $(8,4)$. Note the region affected by this move lies above this diagonal. (This is because the diagonal has slope $\\frac{4-0}{8-0}=\\frac{1}{2}$ and so passes through the points $(2,1)$ and $(4,2)$.)\nThis means that the areas of the regions below and above the line were unaffected by the move.

Notice that $7$ and $24$ are part of the Pythagorean triple $(7,24,25)$ and $5$ and $12$ are part of the Pythagorean triple $(5,12,13)$. Thus, points on $\\ell_1$ only satisfy the conditions when $n$ is divisible by $25$ and points on $\\ell_2$ only satisfy the conditions when $n$ is divisible by $13$. Therefore, $a$ is just the number of positive integers less than $2023$ that are divisible by both $25$ and $13$. The LCM of $25$ and $13$ is $325$, so the answer is $\\boxed{6}$.[/hide]",
      "answer": "6",
      "solution": "1. **Intersection of Lines**:\n   We start by finding the intersection of the lines $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$. The equations are:\n   \\[\n   24x - 7y = 319\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   12x - 5y = 125\n   \\]\n   To find the intersection, we solve this system of linear equations. We can use the method of elimination or substitution. Here, we will use elimination.\n\n2. **Elimination Method**:\n   Multiply the second equation by 2 to align the coefficients of $x$:\n   \\[\n   24x - 10y = 250\n   \\]\n   Now subtract the second equation from the first:\n   \\[\n   (24x - 7y) - (24x - 10y) = 319 - 250\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   3y = 69 \\implies y = 23\n   \\]\n   Substitute $y = 23$ back into the first equation:\n   \\[\n   24x - 7(23) = 319 \\implies 24x - 161 = 319 \\implies 24x = 480 \\implies x = 20\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the intersection point is $(20, 23)$.\n\n3. **Distance from $(20, 23)$**:\n   We need to find lattice points on $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ that are an integer distance $n$ from $(20, 23)$. The distance formula is:\n   \\[\n   d = \\sqrt{(x - 20)^2 + (y - 23)^2}\n   \\]\n   For $d$ to be an integer, $(x - 20)^2 + (y - 23)^2$ must be a perfect square, say $k^2$. Thus:\n   \\[\n   (x - 20)^2 + (y - 23)^2 = n^2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Lattice Points on $\\ell_1$**:\n   The line $\\ell_1$ can be rewritten in slope-intercept form:\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{24}{7}x - \\frac{319}{7}\n   \\]\n   Notice that $24$ and $7$ are part of the Pythagorean triple $(7, 24, 25)$. Therefore, the distance $n$ must be a multiple of $25$ for there to be lattice points on $\\ell_1$.\n\n5. **Lattice Points on $\\ell_2$**:\n   The line $\\ell_2$ can be rewritten in slope-intercept form:\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{12}{5}x - \\frac{125}{5}\n   \\]\n   Notice that $12$ and $5$ are part of the Pythagorean triple $(5, 12, 13)$. Therefore, the distance $n$ must be a multiple of $13$ for there to be lattice points on $\\ell_2$.\n\n6. **Common Multiples**:\n   We need $n$ to be a multiple of both $25$ and $13$. The least common multiple (LCM) of $25$ and $13$ is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{LCM}(25, 13) = 325\n   \\]\n   We need to count the multiples of $325$ that are less than $2023$:\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2023}{325} \\right\\rfloor = 6\n   \\]\n\nConclusion:\nThe number of positive integer values $n$ less than $2023$ such that there exists a lattice point on both $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ at a distance $n$ from $(20, 23)$ is $\\boxed{6}$."

      "answer": "4",
      "solution": "1. **Identify the relevant values of \\(2^k + 1\\):**\n   Since the minor arc \\(AB\\) has at most 9 vertices on it, the relevant values of \\(2^k + 1\\) are \\(3, 5,\\) and \\(9\\). This is because:\n   \\[\n   2^1 + 1 = 3, \\quad 2^2 + 1 = 5, \\quad 2^3 + 1 = 9\n   \\]\n\n2. **Enumerate the vertices:**\n   Enumerate the vertices of the 17-gon as \\(V_0, V_1, \\ldots, V_{16}\\).\n\n3. **Determine the conditions for different colors:**\n   We have that \\(V_i\\) and \\(V_j\\) are of different colors if \\(i - j \\equiv \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8 \\pmod{17}\\). This is derived from the relevant values of \\(2^k + 1\\).\n\n4. **Establish a lower bound for the number of colors:**\n   Since \\(V_0, V_2, V_4\\) must have pairwise distinct colors, we have \\(n \\geq 3\\).\n\n5. **Check if 4 colors suffice:**\n   If there are 4 colors \\(A, B, C,\\) and \\(D\\), we can try to color the vertices such that the condition is satisfied. One possible coloring is:\n   \\[\n   \\{ V_0, V_1, \\cdots, V_{16} \\} = \\{ A, D, B, B, C, C, D, D, B, B, C, A, D, D, B, B, C \\}\n   \\]\n   This coloring ensures that no two vertices \\(V_i\\) and \\(V_j\\) with \\(i - j \\equiv \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8 \\pmod{17}\\) have the same color.

Calculate the total number of students who prefer chocolate, apple, or blueberry pie:\n   \\[\n   12 + 8 + 6 = 26\n   \\]\n\n3.

For even numbers $n \\geq 6$, such bodies therefore exist.\n\nIf one places a four-sided pyramid with a corresponding base on one of the rectangular side faces of such a prism, the number of vertices of the new body increases to $2m+1$ (the apex of the pyramid has been added) and the number of faces increases to $(m+2)-1+4=m+5$ (one face lies inside the new body as the base of the pyramid and thus disappears, while the pyramid adds 4 new faces), which for $m \\geq 5$ is still less than the number of vertices $n=2m+1$. Thus, such bodies also exist for odd $n \\geq 11$.\n\nFor $n=9$, consider a right triangular frustum. This has 3 points each in the base and top face, a total of 6, and 3 additional faces besides the base and top, making a total of 5. If two congruent such frustums are glued together at their bases, the number of vertices of the new body increases to $6+3=9$ and the number of faces increases to $5-1+3+1=8$.

With $e=5$ and $k \\geq 8$, it follows that $f=2-e+f \\geq 2-5+8=5$, so there can be no such body with 5 vertices but fewer than 5 faces.\n\nThus, $N=6$ is indeed the smallest such value."

Three chords intersect at one point, denoted as $T$. The angular measures of the six resulting arcs are marked on the figure. From the similarity of triangles $ATB$ and $A_1TB_1$ it follows (see point 2) the equality $AT / B_1T = \\sin(\\varphi/2) / \\sin(v/2)$. Similarly, $\\triangle B T C \\sim \\Delta B_1 T C_1 \\Rightarrow B_1 T / C T = \\sin(\\psi/2) / \\sin(u/2), \\Delta C T A_1 \\sim \\Delta A T C_1 \\Rightarrow C T / A T = \\sin(\\theta/2) / \\sin(w/2)$.

      "problem": "Let $k$ be a positive integer. Marco and Vera play a game on an infinite grid of square cells. At the beginning, only one cell is black and the rest are white. \n\tA turn in this game consists of the following. Marco moves first, and for every move he must choose a cell which is black and which has more than two white neighbors. (Two cells are neighbors if they share an edge, so every cell has exactly four neighbors.) His move consists of making the chosen black cell white and turning all of its neighbors black if they are not already. Vera then performs the following action exactly $k$ times: she chooses two cells that are neighbors to each other and swaps their colors (she is allowed to swap the colors of two white or of two black cells, though doing so has no effect). This, in totality, is a single turn. If Vera leaves the board so that Marco cannot choose a cell that is black and has more than two white neighbors, then Vera wins; otherwise, another turn occurs.\n\tLet $m$ be the minimal $k$ value such that Vera can guarantee that she wins no matter what Marco does. For $k=m$, let $t$ be the smallest positive integer such that Vera can guarantee, no matter what Marco does, that she wins after at most $t$ turns.

In this case, each point $M$ of the broken line is such that the length of the broken line $SM$ does not exceed $1/2$, and even more so, the distance $SM \\leqslant 1/2$, from which it follows that a circle of radius $1/2$ with center $S$ completely covers the broken line. Thus, every broken line of length 1 can be covered by a circle of radius $1/2$, and the number $1/2$ cannot be reduced, for it is obvious that a segment of length 1 cannot be covered by a circle of radius $<1/2$.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_d4ffc236376258137647g-314.jpg?height=566&width=578&top_left_y=883&top_left_x=310)\n\nFig. 176.\n\nb) We will prove that any closed plane broken line of perimeter 1 can be enclosed within a circle of radius 1/4. Let $A$ be an arbitrary point of our broken line, and $B$ be such a point on the broken line that both parts of the broken line connecting points $A$ and $B$ have the same length $1/2$, and let $Q$ be the midpoint of the segment $AB$ (Fig. 176). Draw a circle of radius $1/4$ with center at point $Q$. We claim that the entire broken line will be enclosed within this circle, i.e., that the distance from any point $M$ of the broken line to point $Q$ is no more than 1/4. Indeed, let $M'$ be the point symmetric to $M$ with respect to point $Q$. Connect $M$ and $M'$ with points $A$ and $B$. Since $AM$ is no greater than the part of the broken line enclosed between points $A$ and $M$, and $BM$ is no greater than the part of the broken line enclosed between points $B$ and $M$, then $AM + BM$ is no greater than the part of the broken line enclosed between points $A$ and $B$, i.e., no greater than $1/2$. But from Fig. 176, it is not difficult to see that $AM = BM', \\quad BM = AM', \\quad QM = QM'$.

Since the diameter of a circle containing the broken line is obviously not less than the diameter of the broken line, no circle of radius less than $1/4$ can cover any closed plane broken line of perimeter 1. Therefore, the required value of the radius of the circle is $1/4$."

      "solution": "【Solution】Solution: Since Jingjing sees the sum of the points on the front, left, and top faces is 16, and Qingqing sees the sum of the points on the top, right, and back faces is 24,\n\nTherefore, $(\\text{front} + \\text{back}) + (\\text{left} + \\text{right}) + \\text{top} \\times 2 = 16 + 24 = 40$,\nAlso, because the sum of the points on opposite faces is 13,\nThen $13 + 13 + \\text{top} \\times 2 = 40$,\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{l}\n26 + \\text{top} \\times 2 = 40, \\\\\n\\text{top} \\times 2 = 40 - 26, \\\\\n\\text{top} = 14 \\div 2, \\\\\n\\text{top} = 7,\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nSo the number of points on the face touching the table is $13 - 7 = 6$.\nTherefore, the answer is: 6."

      "solution": "To find all positive integers \\( k \\) such that there exists an integer \\( a \\) for which \\( (a + k)^3 - a^3 \\) is a multiple of 2007, we start by analyzing the expression \\( (a + k)^3 - a^3 \\).\n\n1. **Expand the expression:**\n   \\[\n   (a + k)^3 - a^3 = a^3 + 3a^2k + 3ak^2 + k^3 - a^3 = 3a^2k + 3ak^2 + k^3\n   \\]\n   Therefore, we need \\( 3a^2k + 3ak^2 + k^3 \\) to be a multiple of 2007.\n\n2. **Factorize 2007:**\n   \\[\n   2007 = 3 \\times 669 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 223 = 3^2 \\times 223\n   \\]\n   So, \\( 2007 \\) is composed of the prime factors \\( 3 \\) and \\( 223 \\).\n\n3. **Check divisibility by 3:**\n   For \\( 3a^2k + 3ak^2 + k^3 \\) to be divisible by \\( 3^2 = 9 \\), we need \\( k \\) to be divisible by 3. This is because:\n   \\[\n   3a^2k + 3ak^2 + k^3 = 3k(a^2 + ak + \\frac{k^2}{3})\n   \\]\n   For this to be divisible by 9, \\( k \\) must be divisible by 3.\n\n4. **Check divisibility by 223:**\n   We need \\( 3a^2k + 3ak^2 + k^3 \\) to be divisible by 223. Since 223 is a prime number, we use Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that for any integer \\( a \\) not divisible by a prime \\( p \\):\n   \\[\n   a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( p = 223 \\), so:\n   \\[\n   a^{222} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{223}\n   \\]\n   We need to find \\( k \\) such that \\( 3a^2k + 3ak^2 + k^3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{223} \\). This is equivalent to finding \\( k \\) such that:\n   \\[\n   k(3a^2 + 3ak + k^2) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{223}\n   \\]\n   Since \\( 223 \\) is prime, \\( k \\) must be divisible by 223 for the product to be zero modulo 223.\n\n5. **Combine conditions:**\n   From the above steps, \\( k \\) must be divisible by both 3 and 223. Therefore, \\( k \\) must be a multiple of:\n   \\[\n   \\text{lcm}(3, 223) = 3 \\times 223 = 669\n   \\]\n\nConclusion:\nThe positive integers \\( k \\) that satisfy the given condition are multiples of 669.\n\nThe final answer is \\( \\boxed{669} \\)."

      "answer": "21",
      "solution": "Answer: 21 candies.\n\nSolution. Let's choose one of the children, for example, Petya. If we take away 7 candies from all the others, there will be as many left as Petya has. This means that twice the number of candies Petya has equals the total number of candies minus seven. The same can be said about any of the children, which means that all the children have the same number of candies - let's say, in piles.\n\nIt is clear that each one ate one whole pile less than the others together. Therefore, 7 is divisible by the size of the pile. Since each one ate more than 1 candy according to the condition, there are 7 candies in each pile, i.e., each one ate one pile less than the others together. Petya ate one pile, so the others ate two. Therefore, there are three piles in total, and 21 candies.\n\nThis solution can also be written algebraically.\n\nLet $S$ be the total number of candies eaten by the children. If one of the children ate $a$ candies, then according to the condition, all the others ate $a+7$ candies, and together they ate $S=a+(a+7)=$ $=2a+7$ candies. This reasoning is valid for each child, so all the children ate the same number of candies: $a=(S-7)/2$ each.\n\nNow let $N$ be the number of children. Then the condition can be written as $a=a(N-1)-7$, from which $7=a(N-2)$. The number 7 is prime, so one of the factors is 1, and the other is 7. But according to the condition $a>1$, so $a=7, N-2=1$. Thus, $N=3$, and a total of $S=aN=21$ candies were eaten."

We need to determine the ratio \\( \\frac{AD}{AC} \\) and prove that \\(\\angle CAB\\) is obtuse while \\(\\angle DAB\\) is acute.\n\n2. **Using the Median Property:**\n   Recall that the median of a triangle divides it into two smaller triangles of equal area.

The difference set \\( (A \\setminus B) \\cup (B \\setminus A) \\) must be one of the two sets.

      "answer": "1",
      "solution": "Solution 1\nThe sum of the digits is at most $9+9+9=27$. Therefore the number is at most $6\\cdot 27 = 162$. Out of the numbers $1$ to $162$ the one with the largest sum of digits is $99$, and the sum is $9+9=18$. Hence the sum of digits will be at most $18$.\nAlso, each number with this property is divisible by $6$, therefore it is divisible by $3$, and thus also its sum of digits is divisible by $3$. Thus, the number is divisible by $18$.\nWe only have six possibilities left for the sum of the digits: $3$, $6$, $9$, $12$, $15$, and $18$, but since the number is divisible by $18$, the digits can only add to $9$ or $18$. This leads to the integers $18$, $36$, $54$, $72$, $90$, and $108$ being possibilities. We can check to see that $\\boxed{1}$ solution: the number $54$ is the only solution that satisfies the conditions in the problem.\n\nSolution 2\nWe can write each integer between $1$ and $999$ inclusive as $\\overline{abc}=100a+10b+c$ where $a,b,c\\in\\{0,1,\\dots,9\\}$ and $a+b+c>0$.\nThe sum of digits of this number is $a+b+c$, hence we get the equation $100a+10b+c = 6(a+b+c)$. This simplifies to $94a + 4b - 5c = 0$. Clearly for $a>0$ there are no solutions, hence $a=0$ and we get the equation $4b=5c$. This obviously has only one valid solution $(b,c)=(5,4)$, hence the only solution is the number $54$.\n\nSolution 3\nThe sum of the digits is at most $9+9+9=27$. Therefore the number is at most $6\\cdot 27 = 162$. Since the number is $6$ times the sum of its digits, it must be divisible by $6$, therefore also by $3$, therefore the sum of its digits must be divisible by $3$. With this in mind we can conclude that the number must be divisible by $18$, not just by $6$. Since the number is divisible by $18$, it is also divisible by $9$, therefore the sum of its digits is divisible by $9$, therefore the number is divisible by $54$, which leaves us with $54$, $108$ and $162$. Only $54$ is $6$ times its digits, hence the answer is $\\boxed{1}$."

Sides are also regarded as odd diagonals. Suppose the 2006-gon has been dissected into triangles by 2003 nonintersecting diagonals. Find the maximum possible number of isosceles triangles with two odd sides. (Serbia)",
      "answer": "1003",
      "solution": "Call an isosceles triangle odd if it has two odd sides. Suppose we are given a dissection as in the problem statement. A triangle in the dissection which is odd and isosceles will be called iso-odd for brevity. Lemma. Let \\( AB \\) be one of the dissecting diagonals and let \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) be the shorter part of the boundary of the 2006-gon with endpoints \\( A, B \\). Suppose that \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) consists of \\( n \\) segments. Then the number of iso-odd triangles with vertices on \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) does not exceed \\( n / 2 \\). Proof. This is obvious for \\( n=2 \\). Take \\( n \\) with \\( 2 < n \\leq 1003 \\) and assume the claim to be true for every \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) of length less than \\( n \\). Let now \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) (endpoints \\( A, B \\)) consist of \\( n \\) segments. Let \\( PQ \\) be the longest diagonal which is a side of an iso-odd triangle \\( PQS \\) with all vertices on \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) (if there is no such triangle, there is nothing to prove). Every triangle whose vertices lie on \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) is obtuse or right-angled; thus \\( S \\) is the summit of \\( PQS \\). We may assume that the five points \\( A, P, S, Q, B \\) lie on \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) in this order and partition \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) into four pieces \\( \\mathcal{L}_{AP}, \\mathcal{L}_{PS}, \\mathcal{L}_{SQ}, \\mathcal{L}_{QB} \\) (the outer ones possibly reducing to a point).\n\nBy the definition of \\( PQ \\), an iso-odd triangle cannot have vertices on both \\( \\mathcal{L}_{AP} \\) and \\( \\mathcal{L}_{QB} \\). Therefore every iso-odd triangle within \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) has all its vertices on just one of the four pieces. Applying to each of these pieces the induction hypothesis and adding the four inequalities we get that the number of iso-odd triangles within \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) other than \\( PQS \\) does not exceed \\( n / 2 \\). And since each of \\( \\mathcal{L}_{PS}, \\mathcal{L}_{SQ} \\) consists of an odd number of sides, the inequalities for these two pieces are actually strict, leaving a \\( 1 / 2 + 1 / 2 \\) in excess. Hence the triangle \\( PQS \\) is also covered by the estimate \\( n / 2 \\). This concludes the induction step and proves the lemma.\n\nThe remaining part of the solution in fact repeats the argument from the above proof. Consider the longest dissecting diagonal \\( XY \\). Let \\( \\mathcal{L}_{XY} \\) be the shorter of the two parts of the boundary with endpoints \\( X, Y \\) and let \\( XYZ \\) be the triangle in the dissection with vertex \\( Z \\) not on \\( \\mathcal{L}_{XY} \\). Notice that \\( XYZ \\) is acute or right-angled, otherwise one of the segments \\( XZ, YZ \\) would be longer than \\( XY \\). Denoting by \\( \\mathcal{L}_{XZ}, \\mathcal{L}_{YZ} \\) the two pieces defined by \\( Z \\) and applying the lemma to each of \\( \\mathcal{L}_{XY}, \\mathcal{L}_{XZ}, \\mathcal{L}_{YZ} \\) we infer that there are no more than 2006/2 iso-odd triangles in all, unless \\( XYZ \\) is one of them. But in that case \\( XZ \\) and \\( YZ \\) are odd diagonals and the corresponding inequalities are strict. This shows that also in this case the total number of iso-odd triangles in the dissection, including \\( XYZ \\), is not greater than 1003.\n\nThis bound can be achieved. For this to happen, it just suffices to select a vertex of the 2006-gon and draw a broken line joining every second vertex, starting from the selected one. Since 2006 is even, the line closes. This already gives us the required 1003 iso-odd triangles. Then we can complete the triangulation in an arbitrary fashion."

      "answer": "1176",
      "solution": "Answer: 1176.\n\nSolution: Let's represent 49 units as points on a plane. Each time we combine numbers, we will connect the points of one group with all the points of the second group with line segments. Note that if we replace numbers $x$ and $y$ with $x+y$, the groups \" $x$ \" and \" $y$ \" will be connected by $x y$ line segments. This is the same number of candies that Karlson eats. After 49 minutes, all points will be connected. In total, $\\frac{49 \\cdot(49-1)}{2}=1176$ line segments will be drawn. Therefore, Karlson will eat 1176 candies."

      "answer": " 8 ",
      "solution": "1. **Restate the problem in a more manageable form:**\n   We need to prove that the number \\(1\\) can be represented as a sum of a finite number \\(n\\) of real numbers, each less than \\(1\\), and each containing only the digits \\(0\\) and \\(7\\) in their decimal representation. We also need to find the least possible value of \\(n\\).\n\n2. **Reformulate the problem using a known rational number:**\n   Consider the rational number \\(\\frac{1}{7} = 0.\\overline{142857}\\). We need to express \\(\\frac{1}{7}\\) as a sum of \\(n\\) real numbers, each less than \\(\\frac{1}{7}\\) and containing only the digits \\(0\\) and \\(1\\) in their decimal representation.\n\n3. **Assume \\(n < 10\\) and find the least value of \\(n\\):**\n   We assume that all the real numbers are positive and that \\(n < 10\\). The least value of \\(n\\) is found to be \\(8\\), for which we have the identity:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{7} = 0.\\overline{1} + 0.\\overline{011111} + 0.\\overline{010111} + 0.\\overline{010111} + 0.\\overline{000111} + 0.\\overline{000101} + 0.\\overline{000101} + 0.\\overline{000100}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Consider the case with both positive and negative real numbers:**\n   Suppose now that \\(\\frac{1}{7}\\) is the sum of \\(i > 0\\) positive real numbers and \\(j > 0\\) negative real numbers, with \\(i + j \\leq 7\\). Denote by \\(u = 0.u_1u_2\\ldots\\) (respectively by \\(-v = -0.v_1v_2\\ldots\\)) the sum of the positive (respectively negative) real numbers, so that \\(\\frac{1}{7} + v = u\\). Note that \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) are necessarily strictly less than \\(1\\).\n\n5. **Analyze the constraints on \\(u\\) and \\(v\\):**\n   Since \\(i, j < 7\\), it follows that \\(v_6 \\geq 3\\), so that \\(j \\geq 3\\) and \\(i \\leq 4\\). Then, we must have \\(v_5 \\geq 4\\), so that \\(j \\geq 4\\) and \\(i \\leq 3\\). In this case, we find \\(u_3 \\geq 3\\) and thus \\(i = 3\\). This finally implies that \\(v_2 \\geq 6\\), which is impossible since \\(j = 4\\).\n\n6. **Conclude the least value of \\(n\\):**\n   The least value of \\(n\\) is therefore \\(8\\).\n\nThe final answer is \\( \\boxed{ 8 } \\)."

      "answer": "\\frac{100}{243}",

In the $n$-th level game, the total number of basic events is $6^n$.\nLevel 1: The number of basic events contained in event $A_{1}$ is 2 (i.e., the cases where the number is 1 or 2),\nSo the probability of passing this level is: $P\\left(\\overline{A_{1}}\\right)=1-P\\left(A_{1}\\right)=1-\\frac{2}{6}=\\frac{2}{3}$\nLevel 2: The number of basic events contained in event $A_{2}$ is the sum of the number of positive integer solutions to the equation $x+y=a$ when $a$ takes the values $2,3,4$.

      "answer": "9599",
      "solution": "2. Solution. Since the desired integer solution $x$ is divisible by 10 and 12, it is divisible by 60, hence it can be written in the form $x=60 t, t \\in Z$. Substitute $x=60 t$ into the original equation:\n\n$3600 t^{2}+60 b t-9600=0$. Express $b: b=\\frac{160}{t}-60 t$. For $b$ to be an integer, $t$ must be a divisor of the number 160. $160=2^{5} \\cdot 5$. The number $160=2^{5} \\cdot 5$ has 12 positive divisors: $1,2,2^{2}, 2^{3}, 2^{4}, 2^{5}, 5,2 \\cdot 5,2^{2} \\cdot 5,2^{3} \\cdot 5,2^{4} \\cdot 5,2^{5} \\cdot 5$. Taking the sign into account, we get 24 divisors. Each of them corresponds to a solution $x=60 t$ and an integer $b=\\frac{160}{t}-60 t$. Therefore, the number of integers $b$ that satisfy the condition of the problem is 24. Since $b$ decreases as $t$ increases, the maximum $b$ corresponds to the smallest $t=-160$, so $b_{\\max }=-1+60 \\cdot 160=9599$."

Thus, the ternary expansions of \\( N_{0} \\) and \\( N_{1} \\) do not contain the digit 2.\nBy the induction hypothesis, the numbers \\( N_{0} \\) and \\( N_{1} \\) are in the sequence.\nSince \\( N_{0} \\), \\( N_{1} \\), and \\( N \\) form an arithmetic sequence, \\( N \\) does not appear in the sequence.

Let point $A$ have coordinates $\\left(x_{1} ; 0\\right)$, and point $C$ have coordinates $\\left(x_{2} ; 0\\right)$. From the condition, it is clear that $x_{1} < 0$ and $x_{2} > 0$. Since $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ are the roots of the quadratic trinomial $f(x)$, by Vieta's theorem, we have $x_{1} \\cdot x_{2} = 12b$, from which we get $b = \\frac{x_{1} \\cdot x_{2}}{12} < 0$.\n\nLet $H$ be the point with coordinates $(3 ; 0)$ (Fig. 11). Clearly, in the isosceles triangle $A T C$, the segment $T H$ is the height, and therefore it is also the median. Thus, $3 - x_{1} = A H = H C = x_{2} - 3$, from which we get $x_{1} = 6 - x_{2}$.\n\nLet $M$ be the point with coordinates $(0, 3)$. Since $T H = T M = 3$ and $T A = T B$, the right triangles $A T H$ and $B T M$ are equal by the leg and hypotenuse. Therefore, $3 - x_{1} = H A = M B = 3 - b$, that is, $x_{1} = b = \\frac{x_{1} \\cdot x_{2}}{12}$ (by Vieta's theorem), from which we find $x_{2} = 12$. Finally, $x_{1} = 6 - x_{2} = 6 - 12 = -6$ and $b = x_{1} = -6$.\n\nAnother solution. As in the previous solution, let the abscissas of points $A$ and $C$ be $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$, respectively; we will also use the fact that point $B$ has coordinates $(0 ; b)$. Immediately, we understand that $O A = |x_{1}| = -x_{1}$, $O C = |x_{2}| = x_{2}$, and $O B = |b| = -b$.\n\nLet's find the second intersection of the circle with the y-axis, let this be point $D$ with coordinates $(0 ; d)$ (Fig. 12). The chords $A C$ and $B D$ of the circle intersect at the origin $O$; from the properties of the circle, we know that $O A \\cdot O C = O B \\cdot O D$. We get $-x_{1} \\cdot x_{2} = -b \\cdot d$, from which, replacing $x_{1} \\cdot x_{2}$ with $12b$ by Vieta's theorem, we get $d = 12$.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_b46fbd582cc3a82460aeg-40.jpg?height=521&width=571&top_left_y=83&top_left_x=437)\n\nFig. 12: to the solution of problem 10.7\n\nIt remains to note that triangle $BTD$ is isosceles, and the midpoint of its base, point $M$, has coordinates $(0 ; 3)$. Reflecting point $D(0 ; 12)$ relative to it, we get $B(0 ; -6)$."

      "answer": "9",
      "solution": "Analysis and Solution: Use points to represent birds. Let the circle with the most points have $r$ points. Clearly, $r \\geqslant 4$. Can $r=4$? Let's first explore the case where $r=4$.\n\nIf $r=4$, i.e., each circle has at most 4 points, but we are considering circles that pass through at least 4 points, so each \"4-point circle\" has exactly 4 points.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the number of \"4-point circles\". Note the condition: any 5-point set has 4 points on a circle, i.e., each \"5-point set\" corresponds to a \"4-point circle\". Thus, we can use a mapping to count the number of circles. In fact, each \"5-point set\" corresponds to one \"4-point circle\", so there are $C_{10}^{5}=252$ \"4-point circles\". However, each \"4-point circle\" can belong to 6 different \"5-point sets\", and is counted 6 times, so the number of \"4-point circles\" is $\\frac{252}{6}=42$. These \"4-point circles\" are distinct. If not, there would be two different 4-point sets $A B C D$ and $A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime} D^{\\prime}$ on the same circle, but $A B C D$ and $A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime} D^{\\prime}$ would have at least 5 distinct points, and these 5 points would be on the same circle, contradicting $r=4$.\n\nStep 2: Observe the partition and use a middle quantity to count twice. The 42 different 4-point circles can be seen as 42 different (possibly intersecting) subsets, denoted as: $M_{1}, M_{2}, \\cdots, M_{42}$, which satisfy: $\\left|M_{i}\\right|=4$, $\\left|M_{i} \\cap M_{j}\\right| \\leqslant 2$. Using the \"addition technique\", we can calculate the number of triangles $S$.\n\nOn one hand, $S=C_{10}^{3}=120$. On the other hand, $S \\geqslant 42 \\mathrm{C}_{4}^{3}=168$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, $r>4$.\nLet $M$ be the circle with the most points, and by $r>4$, $M$ has at least 5 points $A, B, C, D, E$. We will prove: the other points (except possibly one point) are on this circle. (*)\n\nIn fact, suppose there are two points $P, Q$ not on circle $M$, then among the 5 points $P, Q, A, B, C$, 4 points are on a circle. But $P, Q$ are not on circle $A B C$, so $P, Q$ must be on a circle with two of $A, B, C$, say $P, Q, A, B$ are on circle $M_{1}$.\n\nSimilarly, consider the 5 points $P, Q, C, D, E$, there must be 4 points among $P, Q$ and $C, D, E$ on a circle, say $P, Q, C, D$ are on circle $M_{2}$. Now consider the 5 points $P, Q, A, C, E$, there must be 4 points among $P, Q$ and $A, C, E$ on a circle.\n(i) If $P, Q, A, C$ are on circle $M_{3}$, then $M_{3}$ coincides with $M_{1}$, so $P Q A B C$ are on the same circle, and $P, Q$ are on circle $M$, a contradiction.\n(ii) If $P, Q, A, E$ are on circle $M_{3}$, then $M_{3}$ coincides with $M_{1}$, so $P Q A B E$ are on the same circle, and $P, Q$ are on circle $M$, a contradiction.\n(iii) If $P, Q, C, E$ are on circle $M_{3}$, then $M_{3}$ coincides with $M_{2}$, so $P Q C D E$ are on the same circle, and $P, Q$ are on circle $M$, a contradiction.\n\nIn summary, conclusion $(*)$ holds, i.e., $r \\geqslant 9$. Finally, $r=9$ is possible, i.e., 9 points are on the same circle, and the other point is outside the circle, which clearly meets the condition.\n\nIn conclusion, the minimum value of $r$ is 9."

      "problem": "Francisco has 3 daughters: Alina, Valentina, and Civela. An interesting fact is that all three daughters were born on March 18. Today, March 18, 2014, is their birthday. Noting another curious fact, Francisco says:\n\n- Alina, your age is now double the age of Valentina.\n\na) Show that this could never have happened before and that, after the next birthday of Valentina, it will never happen again.\n\nThen, Alina, who was very clever, exclaimed:\n\n- Dad, exactly 10 years ago, the age of one of us three was double the age of another, and in 10 years, the same fact will happen again!\n\nb) It is known that the oldest of the daughters is over 30 years old. How old is Civela?",
      "answer": "15",
      "solution": "Solution\n\na) It is clear that Alina is older than Valentina. Let's call the difference in age between Alina and Valentina $d$. Since they were born on the same day of the year, $d$ does not vary (note that this would not be true if they were born on different days, as in that case, the difference would change on the birthday of each one).\n\nIf Valentina's age today is $\\alpha$, then Alina's age must be $2 \\alpha$, so the age difference between the two is given by:\n\n$$\nd=2 \\alpha-\\alpha\n$$\n\nWe conclude that $d=\\alpha$, so Alina is $2 d$ years old and Valentina is $d$ years old.\n\nSuch a relationship between the ages of Alina and Valentina could not have happened before, as Valentina was younger than $d$ years old. It also will not happen again, as Valentina will be older than $d$ years.\n\nb) Let's call the age of the youngest daughter $A$, the age of the middle daughter $B$, and the age of the oldest daughter $C$. Let $x=B-A$ be the age difference between the two youngest, and $y=C-B$ be the age difference between the two oldest daughters. The age difference between the youngest and the oldest is therefore $C-A=x+y$. Since they were born on the same day of the year, these differences do not vary.\n\nIt is known that in each of the years 2004, 2014, and 2024, the age of one of the daughters was, is, or will be double the age of one of the others. For this, there are only 3 possibilities:\n\n(i) $B$ is double $A$.\n\n(ii) $C$ is double $B$.\n\n(iii) $C$ is double $A$.\n\nBy the reasoning used in part a), we know that each situation can only occur in one of the three years. Therefore, the three situations: (i), (ii), and (iii) must happen in the three years: 2004, 2014, and 2024, but we do not yet know in what order. Also, from part a), we know that:\n\n- When (i) happens, $B$ must be equal to $2 x$ and $A$ must be equal to $x$. Moreover, $C$ is equal to $B+y$, that is, $C$ must be equal to $2 x+y$.\n- When (ii) happens, $B=y, C=2 y$, and therefore, $A=y-x$.\n- When (iii) happens, $C=2(x+y), A=x+y$, and therefore, $B=2 x+y$.\n\nObserve that the ages of $A$ in cases (i), (ii), and (iii) are\n\n$$\nx, \\quad y-x \\quad \\text { and } \\quad x+y\n$$\n\nrespectively. Since $x<x+y$ and $y-x<x+y$, we conclude that $x+y$ is the largest of the three ages and, therefore, (iii) must happen in the year 2024. Only remains to see in which of the two years 2004 or 2014 each of the events in (i) and (ii) happens. Let's assume that (i) and (ii) happen in the years 2014 and 2004, respectively. Then, the ages of $A$ in the years 2004, 2014, and 2024 would be $y-x, x$, and $x+y$, respectively. Thus, we would have the equations\n\n$$\ny-x+10=x \\quad \\text { and } \\quad x+10=x+y\n$$\n\nSolving, we would have $x=10$ and $y=10$. But in that case, $C$ would be today equal to $2 x+y=30$. But the oldest daughter is more than 30 years old, as stated in the problem. We discard, then, this possibility.\n\nWe know then that (i) and (ii) happen in the years 2004 and 2014, respectively. Then, the ages of $A$ in the years 2004, 2014, and 2024 are $x, y-x$, and $x+y$, respectively. Therefore, we have that\n\n$$\nx+10=y-x \\quad \\text { and } \\quad y-x+10=x+y .\n$$\n\nSolving, we get $x=5$ and $y=20$. Finally, the ages of Francisco's daughters today are equal to\n\n$$\ny-x=15, \\quad y=20 \\quad \\text { and } \\quad 2 y=40\n$$\n\nSince Alina's age must be double Valentina's age, the ages of Alina and Valentina must be 40 and 20, respectively. Therefore, Civela is 15 years old today."

This is equivalent to finding a Latin square for each layer of the cube.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have a \\(4 \\times 4 \\times 4\\) cube composed of 64 unit cubes.\n   - We need to color exactly 16 unit cubes red such that each \\(1 \\times 1 \\times 4\\) column contains exactly one red unit cube.\n\n2. **Latin Square Configuration:**\n   - A Latin square of order 4 is a \\(4 \\times 4\\) array filled with numbers 1 to 4, each occurring exactly once in each row and column.\n   - We need to find all possible Latin squares for the \\(4 \\times 4\\) layers of the cube.\n\n3. **Constructing the Latin Squares:**\n   - Start with an initial configuration:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{array}{cccc}\n     1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n     2 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n     3 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n     4 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n     \\end{array}\n     \\]\n   - Fill in the zeros to complete the Latin square. We can generate different Latin squares by permuting the rows and columns.\n\n4. **Generating All Latin Squares:**\n   - The number of distinct Latin squares of order 4 is 576. This can be calculated as \\(4! \\times 3! = 24 \\times 6 = 144\\), but since we need to consider all possible permutations of the layers, we multiply by 4 (for each layer):\n     \\[\n     4 \\times 4! \\times 3! = 4 \\times 24 \\times 6 = 576\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of interesting colorings is 576.\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{576}\\)."

The reciprocal of 1 is 1, which is an integer. Therefore, \\( 10^n \\) does not affect the integrality of \\( S_n \\).\n\n3. **Including 0**: The number 0 is not included in the range from 1 to \\( 10^n \\), so we do not need to consider it.\n\n4. **Symmetry and Grouping**: Every number from 1 to \\( 10^n - 1 \\) can be expressed as an \\( n \\)-digit number with leading zeros allowed.

(a) Since $A B C D$ is a rectangle and $A B=3$, then $D C=3$.\nThus, $D E=D C+C E=3+6=9$.\nNow, the area of trapezoid $A B E D$ is 48 .\nSince $A B C D$ is a rectangle, then $A D$ is perpendicular to $D E$ which means that $A D$ is a height of trapezoid $A B E D$.\nThe area of trapezoid $A B E D$ equals $\\frac{1}{2}(A B+D E) \\times A D$.\n(We could instead note that trapezoid $A B E D$ is made up of a rectangle with base 3 and an unknown height, and a right-angled triangle with base 6 and the same unknown height.) Therefore, $\\frac{1}{2}(3+9) \\times A D=48$ and so $6 \\times A D=48$ which gives $A D=8$.\nSince $A B C D$ is a rectangle, then $B C=A D=8$.\nFinally, by the Pythagorean Theorem, $B E=\\sqrt{B C^{2}+C E^{2}}=\\sqrt{8^{2}+6^{2}}=\\sqrt{100}=10$.\n(b) Draw a perpendicular from $Q$ to $F$ on $P S$.\nQuadrilateral $F Q T S$ has three right angles and so it must be a rectangle.\nTherefore, $F S=Q T$. Since $Q T$ is a radius, then $F S=Q T=16$.\nSince $P S$ is a radius, then $P S=25$.\nTherefore, $P F=P S-F S=25-16=9$.\nWe note that $P Q=P X+X Q=25+16=41$ (they are both radii).\nBy the Pythagorean Theorem in $\\triangle P F Q$, which is right-angled at $F$,\n$$\nF Q=\\sqrt{P Q^{2}-P F^{2}}=\\sqrt{41^{2}-9^{2}}=\\sqrt{1681-81}=40\n$$\n\nSince $F Q T S$ is a rectangle, $S T=F Q=40$.\nFinally, the area of trapezoid $P Q T S$ equals\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}(P S+Q T) \\times S T=\\frac{1}{2}(25+16) \\times 40=41 \\times 20=820\n$$\n(c) Suppose that the centre of the circle of radius $r$ is $O$ and that this circle touches the line $\\ell$ at point $V$.\nJoin $P$ to $O$ and $Q$ to $O$.\nJoin $V$ to $O$. Since the circle is tangent to $\\ell$ at $V, O V$ is perpendicular to $\\ell$. Also, draw perpendiculars from $O$ to $G$ on $P S$ and from $O$ to $H$ on $Q T$.\n\nAs in (b), GOVS is a rectangle with $G S=O V=r$ and $S V=G O$.\nSince $P S=25$, then $P G=P S-G S=25-r$.\nSince $P O$ joins the centres of two tangent circles, then the length of $P O$ equals the sum of the radii of the two circles. In other words, $P O=25+r$.\nBy the Pythagorean Theorem in $\\triangle P O G$,\n$$\nG O^{2}=P O^{2}-P G^{2}=(25+r)^{2}-(25-r)^{2}=\\left(625+50 r+r^{2}\\right)-\\left(625-50 r+r^{2}\\right)=100 r\n$$\n\nSince $G O>0$, then $G O=\\sqrt{100 r}=\\sqrt{100} \\times \\sqrt{r}=10 \\sqrt{r}$.\nThus, $S V=G O=10 \\sqrt{r}$.\nUsing a similar analysis,\n$$\nH O^{2}=Q O^{2}-Q H^{2}=(16+r)^{2}-(16-r)^{2}=\\left(256+32 r+r^{2}\\right)-\\left(256-32 r+r^{2}\\right)=64 r\n$$\n\nSince $H O>0$, then $H O=\\sqrt{64 r}=\\sqrt{64} \\times \\sqrt{r}=8 \\sqrt{r}$.\nThus, $T V=H O=8 \\sqrt{r}$.\nFrom (b), $S T=40$ and so $S V+T V=40$.\nTherefore, $10 \\sqrt{r}+8 \\sqrt{r}=40$ which gives $18 \\sqrt{r}=40$ and so $\\sqrt{r}=\\frac{40}{18}=\\frac{20}{9}$.\nFinally, $r=\\left(\\frac{20}{9}\\right)^{2}=\\frac{400}{81}$."

Certainly, $q$ divides both $N_{1}$ and $N_{2}$, so we have that\n\n$$\nq \\text { divides } \\operatorname{GCD}\\left(N_{1}, N_{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nWe find that $N_{1}=2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 7, N_{2}=8 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 12 \\cdot 13$. Therefore, $\\operatorname{GCD}\\left(N_{1}, N_{2}\\right)=2^{4} \\cdot 3^{2} \\cdot 5$. Now, from 1 and 2, it follows that $q=2^{4} \\cdot 3^{2} \\cdot 5$. To extract the maximum square from $q$, we find that $k^{2}=2^{4} \\cdot 3^{2}$, which means $k=12$."

Point $M$ divides the segment $A 1 C 1$ in the ratio $1: 3$, counting from $A 1$. Find the area of the section of the cube by the plane passing through points $K, L, M$.",

      "solution": "Let the line $L K$ intersect the edge $C D$ at point $F$ (Fig.1). According to the theorem on the intersection of two parallel planes by a third intersecting plane, the plane intersects the base $A 1 B 1 C 1 D 1$ along a line $a$, passing through point $M$ parallel to $L F$. Let the line $a$ intersect the lines $A 1 B 1$ and $C 1 D 1$ at points $N$ and $E$ respectively, and let points $L 1$, $F 1$, and $K 1$ be the orthogonal projections of points $L$, $F$, and $K$ onto the plane $A 1 B 1 C 1 D 1$. Denote $\\angle B K L = \\angle B 1 K 1 L 1 = \\alpha$.

Then $C 1 E = 6$, $A 1 N = 2$. Points $E$ and $N$ lie on the sides $C 1 D 1$ and $A 1 B 1$. Therefore, the section of the given cube by the plane passing through points $K, L$, and $M$ is a parallelogram $L F E N$. Drop a perpendicular $L H$ from point $L$ to the line $NE$ (Fig.1). Then $L H$ is the height of the parallelogram $L F E N$. By the theorem of three perpendiculars, $L 1 H \\perp N E$.

The 5 subsets $A_{i}(i=1,2, \\cdots, 5)$ contain a total of $5 n$ elements.\n(1) If there is 1 element that appears 5 times, then the other elements appear at most 2 times. Thus, the 5 subsets contain at most $5 + 2(2 n-1) = 4 n + 3$ elements, which is a contradiction.\n(2) If there are 2 elements each appearing 4 times, then these 2 elements must appear together in at least 3 subsets, which is a contradiction.\n(3) If exactly 1 element appears 4 times, and let the number of elements appearing 3 times be $s$, then\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}\n4 + 3 s + 2(2 n - s - 1) \\geq 5 n \\\\\n\\Rightarrow s \\geq n - 2 .\n\\end{array}\n$$\n(i) When $s > n - 2$, at least $n$ elements each appear at least 3 times;\n(ii) When $s = n - 2$, there is 1 element appearing 4 times, and $n - 2$ elements each appearing 3 times.\n(4) If no element appears 4 times, and let the number of elements appearing 3 times be $s$.

What is the area of this octagon?",

      "solution": "1. **Define the vertices and midpoints:**\n   Given the square \\(ABCD\\) with side length \\(6\\), we can place the vertices at:\n   \\[\n   A(0,0), \\quad B(6,0), \\quad C(6,6), \\quad D(0,6)\n   \\]\n   The midpoints of each side are:\n   \\[\n   E(3,0), \\quad F(6,3), \\quad G(3,6), \\quad H(0,3)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the intersection points:**\n   We draw line segments from the midpoints to the opposite vertices. Specifically:\n   - From \\(E\\) to \\(C\\) and \\(D\\)\n   - From \\(F\\) to \\(A\\) and \\(D\\)\n   - From \\(G\\) to \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)\n   - From \\(H\\) to \\(B\\) and \\(C\\)\n\n   We need to find the intersection points of these lines inside the square. Let's denote these intersection points as follows:\n   - \\(AF \\cap BH = J\\)\n   - \\(BH \\cap DE = I\\)\n   - \\(AF \\cap CE = K\\)\n   - \\(DE \\cap CF = L\\)\n\n3. **Calculate the coordinates of the intersection points:**\n   - For \\(J\\), the line \\(AF\\) has the equation \\(y = \\frac{1}{2}x\\) and the line \\(BH\\) has the equation \\(y = -\\frac{1}{2}x + 3\\). Solving these equations:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{2}x = -\\frac{1}{2}x + 3 \\implies x = 3, \\quad y = \\frac{1}{2}(3) = \\frac{3}{2}\n     \\]\n     So, \\(J(3, \\frac{3}{2})\\).\n\n   - For \\(I\\), the line \\(BH\\) has the equation \\(y = -\\frac{1}{2}x + 3\\) and the line \\(DE\\) has the equation \\(y = x - 3\\). Solving these equations:\n     \\[\n     -\\frac{1}{2}x + 3 = x - 3 \\implies 3 = \\frac{3}{2}x - 3 \\implies 6 = \\frac{3}{2}x \\implies x = 4, \\quad y = 4 - 3 = 1\n     \\]\n     So, \\(I(4, 1)\\).\n\n   - For \\(K\\), the line \\(AF\\) has the equation \\(y = \\frac{1}{2}x\\) and the line \\(CE\\) has the equation \\(y = -\\frac{1}{2}x + 6\\).

Solving these equations:\n     \\[\n     x - 3 = -\\frac{1}{2}x + 6 \\implies x + \\frac{1}{2}x = 9 \\implies \\frac{3}{2}x = 9 \\implies x = 6, \\quad y = 6 - 3 = 3\n     \\]\n     So, \\(L(6, 3)\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the area of the octagon:**\n   The octagon is symmetric and can be divided into four congruent rhombuses. Each rhombus has vertices at the center of the square and two intersection points. For example, consider the rhombus \\(IJKO\\) with:\n   - \\(I(4, 1)\\)\n   - \\(J(3, \\frac{3}{2})\\)\n   - \\(K(6, 3)\\)\n   - \\(O(3, 3)\\)\n\n   The area of one rhombus can be calculated using the formula for the area of a rhombus:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times d_1 \\times d_2\n   \\]\n   where \\(d_1\\) and \\(d_2\\) are the lengths of the diagonals. For rhombus \\(IJKO\\):\n   - \\(d_1 = \\text{distance between } I \\text{ and } K = 2\\)\n   - \\(d_2 = \\text{distance between } J \\text{ and } O = \\frac{3}{2}\\)\n\n   Therefore, the area of one rhombus is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Since there are four such rhombuses in the octagon, the total area of the octagon is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{6}\\)."

We make use of these facts several times in what follows; for example, when we mention collinearity.\n\nLet the centre of the small semicircle be $C$, that of the circle be $P$, and let the circle touch the small semicircle at $T$, noting that $C, T$ and $P$ are collinear.\n\nLet the circle touch the large semicircle at $S$. Then $O, P$ and $S$ are also collinear.\n\nFinally let the circle touch the diameter of the large semicircle at $R$, so that $\\angle P R C=90^{\\circ}$, as shown.\nWe have $O A=2$ and $O C=1$. Let the radius of the circle be $r$, so that $P O=2-r$, and let $O R=x$.\nNow, applying Pythagoras' theorem to triangle $O R P$, we get $x^{2}+r^{2}=(2-r)^{2}$. It follows that\n$$\nx^{2}=4-4 r \\text {. }\n$$\n\nAlso, applying Pythagoras' theorem to triangle $C R P$, we have $(1+x)^{2}+r^{2}=(1+r)^{2}$.

      "solution": "Let, for example, cell $A$, which contains three grains, is $k$ cells to the left and $n$ cells below cell $B$, which contains 17 grains. Consider the shortest paths leading from cell $A$ to cell $B$. Each such path consists of $k$ steps to the neighboring cell to the right and $n$ steps to the neighboring cell upwards, made in any order, that is, in any case, such a path consists of $k+n$ steps. At each step, the number of grains changes by exactly 1, and over the entire path, the number of grains changes by $17-3=14$. However, given the size of the chessboard, the number of possible steps both upwards and to the right cannot exceed 7, meaning the shortest path cannot contain more than 14 steps. Therefore, there must be exactly 7 steps to the right and exactly 7 steps upwards, and the number of grains must increase at each step. Thus, if cell $A$ is below and to the left of cell $B$, then both lie on the main diagonal leading to the upper right ($A$ in the lower left corner, and $B$ in the upper right).

      "solution": "1. **Identify the properties of the primes:**\n   Given that \\( p < q < r < s \\) are prime numbers and \\( pqrs + 1 = 4^{p+q} \\), we first note that \\( p, q, r, s \\) cannot be 2 because if any of them were 2, the left-hand side (LHS) would be odd, while the right-hand side (RHS) would be even, which is a contradiction. Therefore, \\( p, q, r, s \\) are all odd primes.\n\n2. **Analyze the parity of \\( p+q \\):**\n   Since \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are odd primes, their sum \\( p+q \\) is even. Let \\( p+q = 2k \\) for some integer \\( k \\). This implies that \\( 4^{p+q} = 4^{2k} = (2^2)^{2k} = 2^{4k} \\).\n\n3. **Use modular arithmetic:**\n   We know that \\( 4^{p+q} - 1 \\) must be divisible by \\( 15 \\) because \\( 4^2 - 1 = 15 \\).

For $k=2$, the inequality can be simplified to $\\frac{1}{2}(a+b) \\geqq \\sqrt{a b}$, which is the well-known inequality between the arithmetic and geometric means, valid for any positive numbers $a, b$. The largest $k$ we are looking for is therefore at least 2. Let's further examine the given inequality under the assumption $k \\geqq 2$.\n\nBy equivalent manipulation (since $k+2>0$), we get\n\n$$\n2\\left(a^{2}+k a b+b^{2}\\right) \\geqq(k+2)(a+b) \\sqrt{a b}\n$$\n\nand by dividing both sides by the positive number $b^{2}$, we have\n\n$$\n2\\left(\\frac{a^{2}}{b^{2}}+k \\frac{a}{b}+1\\right) \\geqq(k+2)\\left(\\frac{a}{b}+1\\right) \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{b}} .\n$$\n\nLet $\\sqrt{a / b}=x$. By a suitable choice of positive numbers $a, b$, $x$ can take any positive value. Therefore, it suffices to consider the inequality\n\n$$\n2\\left(x^{4}+k x^{2}+1\\right) \\geqq(k+2)\\left(x^{2}+1\\right) x\n$$\n\nand find the largest $k$ such that the above inequality holds for every positive $x$. After simple equivalent manipulations aimed at isolating $k$, we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nk\\left(\\left(x^{2}+1\\right) x-2 x^{2}\\right) & \\leqq 2\\left(x^{4}+1-\\left(x^{2}+1\\right) x\\right), \\\\\nk\\left(x^{3}-2 x^{2}+x\\right) & \\leqq 2\\left(x^{4}-x^{3}-x+1\\right), \\\\\nk x\\left(x^{2}-2 x+1\\right) & \\leqq 2\\left(x^{3}(x-1)-(x-1)\\right), \\\\\nk x(x-1)^{2} & \\leqq 2(x-1)^{2}\\left(x^{2}+x+1\\right) .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFor $x=1$, the last inequality is always satisfied. For $x \\neq 1$, we divide the inequality by the positive expression $x(x-1)^{2}$ and obtain a direct estimate for $k$:\n\n$$\nk \\leqq \\frac{2\\left(x^{2}+x+1\\right)}{x}=2+2\\left(x+\\frac{1}{x}\\right)\n$$\n\nFor positive $x$, $x+1 / x \\geqq 2$ with equality only for $x=1$. For $x \\neq 1$, the expression $x+1 / x$ takes all values in the interval $(2, \\infty)$, and the right-hand side (1) thus takes all values in the interval $(6, \\infty)$. From this, it is clear that the largest $k$ such that (1) holds for all positive $x \\neq 1$ is $k=6$."

      "answer": "300",
      "solution": "1. Let \\( n \\) be a natural number such that the sum of its digits is 100. We can represent \\( n \\) in its decimal form as:\n   \\[\n   n = 10^k a_k + 10^{k-1} a_{k-1} + \\ldots + 10 a_1 + a_0\n   \\]\n   where \\( a_i \\) are the digits of \\( n \\). Therefore, the sum of the digits of \\( n \\) is:\n   \\[\n   a_k + a_{k-1} + \\ldots + a_1 + a_0 = 100\n   \\]\n\n2. Given that the sum of the digits of \\( 44n \\) equals 800, we need to analyze the representation of \\( 44n \\). We can write:\n   \\[\n   44n = 44 \\cdot (10^k a_k + 10^{k-1} a_{k-1} + \\ldots + 10 a_1 + a_0)\n   \\]\n   Expanding this, we get:\n   \\[\n   44n = 10^{k+1} (4a_k) + 10^k (4a_k + 4a_{k-1}) + 10^{k-1} (4a_{k-1} + 4a_{k-2}) + \\ldots + 10 (4a_1 + 4a_0) + 4a_0\n   \\]\n\n3. The sum of the digits in this representation is:\n   \\[\n   4a_k + 4a_k + 4a_{k-1} + 4a_{k-1} + \\ldots + 4a_0 + 4a_0 = 800\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   8(a_k + a_{k-1} + \\ldots + a_1 + a_0) = 800\n   \\]\n   Since \\( a_k + a_{k-1} + \\ldots + a_1 + a_0 = 100 \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   8 \\cdot 100 = 800\n   \\]\n\n4. To ensure there are no carries in the sum of the digits of \\( 44n \\), we must have \\( 4a_i + 4a_{i-1} < 10 \\) for all \\( i \\). This implies:\n   \\[\n   a_i + a_{i+1} \\leq 2\n   \\]\n   for all \\( i \\).\n\n5. Now, we need to determine the sum of the digits of \\( 3n \\). Since \\( a_i + a_{i+1} \\leq 2 \\), multiplying by 3 will not cause any carries. Therefore, the sum of the digits of \\( 3n \\) is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\cdot (a_k + a_{k-1} + \\ldots + a_1 + a_0) = 3 \\cdot 100 = 300\n   \\]\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{300}\\)."

Nikolai Nikolaevich, who arrived first, absent-mindedly sat not in his own place, but in the next one clockwise. Each subsequent jury member, approaching the table, would take their own place or, if it was already occupied, walk around the table clockwise and sit in the first available place. The resulting seating arrangement of the jury members depends on the order in which they approached the table. How many different seating arrangements can arise?",
      "answer": "1024",
      "solution": "Let's consider a certain way of seating the jury members. We will call a jury member lucky if they are sitting in their own seat. The first of the unlucky ones (excluding Nikolai Nikolaevich) to approach the table is the one whose seat is taken by Nikolai Nikolaevich (another unlucky one would sit in their still free seat, which contradicts their unluckiness). He takes the seat of the next (clockwise) unlucky jury member. The second of the unlucky ones to approach is the one whose seat is taken by the first unlucky one (for the same reason), and so on. Thus, each unlucky one sits in the next \"unlucky\" seat after their own.\n\nTherefore, the seating arrangement is uniquely determined by the division of the jury into lucky and unlucky members. Nikolai Nikolaevich and the one whose seat he took are always unlucky. Any subset of the jury members, not including these two, can be the set of lucky ones. Such a seating arrangement can be implemented, for example, as follows: after Nikolai Nikolaevich, all those we have chosen as lucky (in any order) enter, and then all the others in the order of their seating around the table clockwise. Therefore, the number of seating arrangements is equal to the number of subsets of a set of 10 people, which is \\(2^{10}=1024\\).\n\n## Answer\n\n1024 ways."

      "solution": "Let $\\angle A B D=\\angle A D B=\\alpha, \\angle B A C=\\angle A C B=\\beta$. By the external angle theorem of a triangle, $\\angle B M C=\\alpha+\\beta$.

Let point $A$ have coordinates $\\left(x_{1} ; 0\\right)$, and point $C$ have coordinates $\\left(x_{2} ; 0\\right)$. From the condition, it is clear that $x_{1} < 0$ and $x_{2} > 0$. Since $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ are the roots of the quadratic trinomial $f(x)$, by Vieta's theorem, we have $x_{1} \\cdot x_{2} = 12b$, from which we get $b = \\frac{x_{1} \\cdot x_{2}}{12} < 0$.\n\nLet $H$ be the point with coordinates $(3 ; 0)$ (Fig. 11). Clearly, in the isosceles triangle $A T C$, the segment $T H$ is the height, and therefore it is also the median. Thus, $3 - x_{1} = A H = H C = x_{2} - 3$, from which we get $x_{1} = 6 - x_{2}$.\n\nLet $M$ be the point with coordinates $(0, 3)$. Since $T H = T M = 3$ and $T A = T B$, the right triangles $A T H$ and $B T M$ are equal by the leg and hypotenuse. Therefore, $3 - x_{1} = H A = M B = 3 - b$, that is, $x_{1} = b = \\frac{x_{1} \\cdot x_{2}}{12}$ (by Vieta's theorem), from which we find $x_{2} = 12$. Finally, $x_{1} = 6 - x_{2} = 6 - 12 = -6$ and $b = x_{1} = -6$.\n\nAnother solution. As in the previous solution, let the abscissas of points $A$ and $C$ be $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$, respectively; we will also use the fact that point $B$ has coordinates $(0 ; b)$. Immediately, we understand that $O A = |x_{1}| = -x_{1}$, $O C = |x_{2}| = x_{2}$, and $O B = |b| = -b$.\n\nLet's find the second intersection of the circle with the y-axis, let this be point $D$ with coordinates $(0 ; d)$ (Fig. 12). The chords $A C$ and $B D$ of the circle intersect at the origin $O$; from the properties of the circle, we know that $O A \\cdot O C = O B \\cdot O D$. We get $-x_{1} \\cdot x_{2} = -b \\cdot d$, from which, replacing $x_{1} \\cdot x_{2}$ with $12b$ by Vieta's theorem, we get $d = 12$.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_86512448fd32765ac040g-40.jpg?height=521&width=571&top_left_y=83&top_left_x=437)\n\nFig. 12: to the solution of problem 10.7\n\nIt remains to note that triangle $BTD$ is isosceles, and the midpoint of its base, point $M$, has coordinates $(0 ; 3)$. Reflecting point $D(0 ; 12)$ relative to it, we get $B(0 ; -6)$."

Now, five families, Zhao, Qian, Sun, Li, and Zhou, have moved in. One day, the five of them were chatting in the garden:\nZhao said: “My family is the 3rd to move in, and the 1st to move in lives right across from me.”\nQian said: “Only my family lives on the top floor.”\nSun said: “When my family moved in, the same side of the floor above and below us were already occupied.”\nLi said: “My family is the last of the five to move in, and the floor below us is completely empty.”\nZhou said: “My family lives in room 106, room 104 is empty, and room 108 is also empty.”\nAll of what they said is true.

      "solution": "【Answer】Solution: According to the analysis, since 104 and 108 are both vacant, and Sun has neighbors both upstairs and downstairs, Sun must live on the left side,\n\nOnly the Qian family lives on the top floor, which means the remaining 4 people live in 6 of the 101, 102, 103, 105, 106, 107 units,\n\nThe completely vacant floor can only be the first or second floor, so that Sun and the neighbors upstairs and downstairs can all have people.\nIf the first floor is completely vacant, then Li lives in 103 on the second floor, and Li is the last to move in, so Sun lives in 107, and 105 and 109 were occupied before this, Zhao is the third to move in, so Sun must be the fourth to move in, according to what Qian said,\n\nQian lives in 109, with neighbors in 105 and 106, Zhou lives in 106, so Zhao lives in 105, and Zhou is the first to move in,\n\nTherefore, the answer is: 69573."

      "solution": "19. Clearly, if\n$3.6^{\\circ}1$, then let\n$n_{1}=\\frac{n}{d}, n_{2}=\\frac{2004}{d}$.\nAt this point, we have $\\alpha=\\frac{n_{1} \\times 360^{\\circ}}{n_{2}}$.\nThis means that after the pointer rotates $n_{2}$ times, each time rotating by $\\alpha$, the pointer will rotate $n_{1}$ full circles and return to its initial position, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nFrom the above discussion, we know that for any $n$ satisfying $21 \\leqslant n \\leqslant 1001$ and $(n, 2004)=1$, there corresponds a possible $\\alpha$. Conversely, this is also true. Therefore, the problem becomes finding the number of all $n$ that satisfy the above two conditions.\nSince $2004=2^{2} \\times 3 \\times 167$,\nwe have $(n, 2004)=1 \\Leftrightarrow 2 \\chi_{n}, 3 \\psi_{n}, 167 \\uparrow_{n}$.\nAmong the positive integers not greater than 1001, the number of positive integers that are not divisible by 2 or 3 is\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}\n1001-\\left(\\left[\\frac{1001}{2}\\right]+\\left[\\frac{1001}{3}\\right]-\\left[\\frac{1001}{2 \\times 3}\\right]\\right) \\\\\n=1001-(500+333-166)=334 \\text { (numbers). }\n\\end{array}\n$$\n(The symbol $[a]$ represents the greatest integer not exceeding $a$.)\nAmong them, only $1 \\times 167$ and $5 \\times 167$ are divisible by 167, so the number of $n$ not greater than 1001 and satisfying the conditions is $334-2=332$. Removing the 7 numbers $1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19$ that are not greater than 20, we find that the number of $n$ satisfying both conditions is $332-7=325$.\nTherefore, $\\alpha$ has 325 possible distinct values."

Let $A_{1}=\\{1,2,4,5,6,11,13\\}$, and denote the 7-element subset of $S$ obtained by rotating $A_{1}$ clockwise by $j-1$ unit arcs as $A_{j}(j=2,3, \\cdots, 15)$, where a unit arc is one-fifteenth of the circumference. Figure 4-14(b) illustrates $A_{1}$, with the numbers on the inner arcs indicating the number of unit arcs they contain.\nWe now prove that the constructed $A=\\left\\{A_{1}, A_{2}, \\cdots, A_{15}\\right\\}$ meets the problem's requirements.\n(1) Clearly, each set in $A$ consists of exactly 7 elements of $S$.\n(2) If $1 \\leqslant j-i \\leqslant 7$, then rotating $A_{i}$ clockwise by $j-i$ unit arcs results in $A_{j}$. From the diagram of $A_{1}$ (Figure 4-14(b)), we see that there are exactly 3 pairs of elements separated by unit arcs of lengths 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, and each $A_{i}$ has the same property. Therefore, rotating $A_{i}$ clockwise by $j-i$ unit arcs results in exactly 3 elements of $A_{i}$ landing in positions where the elements are in $A_{j}$, so $\\left|A_{i} \\cap A_{j}\\right|=3$.\n\nIf $8 \\leqslant j-i \\leqslant 14$, then rotating $A_{j}$ clockwise by $15-(j-i)$ unit arcs results in $A_{i}$, and similarly, we can conclude that $\\left|A_{i} \\cap A_{j}\\right|=3$.\n(3) Let $M=\\{u, v, w\\}$ be any three-element subset of $S$. Without loss of generality, assume $u, v, w$ are arranged clockwise on the circle. Consider the number of unit arcs between $u$ and $v$, $v$ and $w$, and $w$ and $u$, and denote the smaller two numbers of these arcs as $(a, b)$ (in clockwise order). Clearly, $1 \\leqslant a, b \\leqslant 7$, and except for the pair $(5,5)$, all other pairs $(a, b)$ satisfy $a+b \\leqslant 9$.\n\nObserving the diagram of $A_{1}$ (Figure 4-14(b)), we see that each type of $(a, b)$ three-element set appears exactly once in $A_{1}$:\n$$\n(1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(1,3),(3,1),(1,4),(4,1),(1,5),(5,1),(1,6),(6,1),(1,7),(7,1);\n(2,2),(2,3),(3,2),(2,4),(4,2),(2,5),(5,2),(2,6),(6,2);\n(3,3),(3,4),(4,3),(3,5),(5,3),(3,6),(6,3);\n(4,4),(4,5),(5,4),(5,5).\n$$\nAccordingly, any three-element subset $M$ of $S$ is contained in at least one set in $A$ (for example, the three-element subset $\\{3,8,11\\}$ of $S$ corresponds to the ordered pair $(5,3)$, and the three-element subset in $A_{1}$ corresponding to the ordered pair $(5,3)$ is $\\{11, 1, 4\\}$. Since $11-3=8$, we know that $A_{8}=\\{8,9,11,12,13,3,5\\}$ contains the three-element subset $\\{3,8,11\\}$. In fact, each three-element subset of $S$ is contained in exactly one set in $A$).\nIn summary, the minimum value of $n$ is 15."

      "answer": "66",
      "solution": "The plane does not intersect at least one edge in each face.\n\n## Solution\n\nThe answer is 66. We need to prove that this number is possible, and that a larger number is impossible. First, let's prove the latter. Each face of the polyhedron is intersected by the plane in no more than two edges, meaning that at least one edge belonging to the face remains unintersected. Therefore, in each face, the unintersected edges constitute no less than a third of the total number of edges (in that face). Summing up all these inequalities for all faces, and considering that each edge belongs to two faces, we obtain the desired statement. We will provide an example of a convex polyhedron, 66 edges of which are intersected by a certain plane, not passing through its vertices. Consider a regular 100-gon in the plane; consider a segment of its contour - a broken line \\(L\\) consisting of 32 sides; denote its vertices as \\( \\mathrm{C}_{1}, \\mathrm{C}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathrm{C}_{33} \\).

(The winner gets 1 point per game, the loser gets 0 points, and in a draw, both get 0.5 points)",
      "answer": "8.5, 8, 6.5, 6, 5.5, 4.5",
      "solution": "Let the scores of the ten selected players be $x_{1}, x_{2}, \\cdots, x_{10}$.\n(1) Obviously, the result of the match between the first and second place is a draw. Thus, $x_{1} \\leqslant 8.5, x_{2} \\leqslant 8$.\n(2) The last four players have a total of 6 matches among themselves, so their total score $x_{1} + x_{8} + x_{9} + x_{10} \\geqslant 6$.\n(3) Since the score of the fourth place is equal to the total score of the last four players, $x_{4} \\geqslant 6$, thus $x_{3} \\geqslant 6.5$.\n(4) If $x_{3} \\geqslant 7$, then $x_{1} + x_{2} = x_{3} + 10 \\geqslant 17$, which contradicts the result in (1), so $x_{3} < 7$, hence $x_{3} = 6.5$.\n(5) Therefore, $x_{4} = 6, x_{1} + x_{2} = 16.5$, thus $x_{1} = 8.5, x_{2} = 8$.\n(6) All ten players participate in a total of 45 matches, scoring 45 points, so the total score of the last six players is $45 - (8.5 + 8 - 6.5 + 6) = 16$ points, and the total score of the last four players is 6 points, thus $x_{5} + x_{6} = 10$, hence $x_{5} = 5.5, x_{6} = 4.5$.\n\nIn summary, the scores of the top six players are 8.5 points, 8 points, 6.5 points, 6 points, 5.5 points, and 4.5 points, respectively."
