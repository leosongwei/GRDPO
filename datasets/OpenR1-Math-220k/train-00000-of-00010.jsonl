Thus:\n   \\[\n   (x - 20)^2 + (y - 23)^2 = n^2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Lattice Points on $\\ell_1$**:\n   The line $\\ell_1$ can be rewritten in slope-intercept form:\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{24}{7}x - \\frac{319}{7}\n   \\]\n   Notice that $24$ and $7$ are part of the Pythagorean triple $(7, 24, 25)$. Therefore, the distance $n$ must be a multiple of $25$ for there to be lattice points on $\\ell_1$.\n\n5. **Lattice Points on $\\ell_2$**:\n   The line $\\ell_2$ can be rewritten in slope-intercept form:\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{12}{5}x - \\frac{125}{5}\n   \\]\n   Notice that $12$ and $5$ are part of the Pythagorean triple $(5, 12, 13)$. Therefore, the distance $n$ must be a multiple of $13$ for there to be lattice points on $\\ell_2$.\n\n6. **Common Multiples**:\n   We need $n$ to be a multiple of both $25$ and $13$. The least common multiple (LCM) of $25$ and $13$ is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{LCM}(25, 13) = 325\n   \\]\n   We need to count the multiples of $325$ that are less than $2023$:\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2023}{325} \\right\\rfloor = 6\n   \\]\n\nConclusion:\nThe number of positive integer values $n$ less than $2023$ such that there exists a lattice point on both $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ at a distance $n$ from $(20, 23)$ is $\\boxed{6}$."}
{"Index": 58, "problem": "2. How many integers $b$ exist such that the equation $x^{2}+b x-9600=0$ has an integer solution that is a multiple of both 10 and 12? Specify the largest possible $b$.", "answer": "9599", "solution": "2. Solution. Since the desired integer solution $x$ is divisible by 10 and 12, it is divisible by 60, hence it can be written in the form $x=60 t, t \\in Z$. Substitute $x=60 t$ into the original equation:\n\n$3600 t^{2}+60 b t-9600=0$. Express $b: b=\\frac{160}{t}-60 t$. For $b$ to be an integer, $t$ must be a divisor of the number 160. $160=2^{5} \\cdot 5$. The number $160=2^{5} \\cdot 5$ has 12 positive divisors: $1,2,2^{2}, 2^{3}, 2^{4}, 2^{5}, 5,2 \\cdot 5,2^{2} \\cdot 5,2^{3} \\cdot 5,2^{4} \\cdot 5,2^{5} \\cdot 5$. Taking the sign into account, we get 24 divisors. Each of them corresponds to a solution $x=60 t$ and an integer $b=\\frac{160}{t}-60 t$. Therefore, the number of integers $b$ that satisfy the condition of the problem is 24. Since $b$ decreases as $t$ increases, the maximum $b$ corresponds to the smallest $t=-160$, so $b_{\\max }=-1+60 \\cdot 160=9599$."}

Let point $A$ have coordinates $\\left(x_{1} ; 0\\right)$, and point $C$ have coordinates $\\left(x_{2} ; 0\\right)$. From the condition, it is clear that $x_{1} < 0$ and $x_{2} > 0$. Since $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ are the roots of the quadratic trinomial $f(x)$, by Vieta's theorem, we have $x_{1} \\cdot x_{2} = 12b$, from which we get $b = \\frac{x_{1} \\cdot x_{2}}{12} < 0$.\n\nLet $H$ be the point with coordinates $(3 ; 0)$ (Fig. 11). Clearly, in the isosceles triangle $A T C$, the segment $T H$ is the height, and therefore it is also the median. Thus, $3 - x_{1} = A H = H C = x_{2} - 3$, from which we get $x_{1} = 6 - x_{2}$.\n\nLet $M$ be the point with coordinates $(0, 3)$. Since $T H = T M = 3$ and $T A = T B$, the right triangles $A T H$ and $B T M$ are equal by the leg and hypotenuse. Therefore, $3 - x_{1} = H A = M B = 3 - b$, that is, $x_{1} = b = \\frac{x_{1} \\cdot x_{2}}{12}$ (by Vieta's theorem), from which we find $x_{2} = 12$. Finally, $x_{1} = 6 - x_{2} = 6 - 12 = -6$ and $b = x_{1} = -6$.\n\nAnother solution. As in the previous solution, let the abscissas of points $A$ and $C$ be $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$, respectively; we will also use the fact that point $B$ has coordinates $(0 ; b)$. Immediately, we understand that $O A = |x_{1}| = -x_{1}$, $O C = |x_{2}| = x_{2}$, and $O B = |b| = -b$.\n\nLet's find the second intersection of the circle with the y-axis, let this be point $D$ with coordinates $(0 ; d)$ (Fig. 12). The chords $A C$ and $B D$ of the circle intersect at the origin $O$; from the properties of the circle, we know that $O A \\cdot O C = O B \\cdot O D$. We get $-x_{1} \\cdot x_{2} = -b \\cdot d$, from which, replacing $x_{1} \\cdot x_{2}$ with $12b$ by Vieta's theorem, we get $d = 12$.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_b46fbd582cc3a82460aeg-40.jpg?height=521&width=571&top_left_y=83&top_left_x=437)\n\nFig. 12: to the solution of problem 10.7\n\nIt remains to note that triangle $BTD$ is isosceles, and the midpoint of its base, point $M$, has coordinates $(0 ; 3)$.

What is the maximum number of birds on the circumference that has the most birds? (6th China Mathematical Olympiad)", "answer": "9", "solution": "Analysis and Solution: Use points to represent birds. Let the circle with the most points have $r$ points. Clearly, $r \\geqslant 4$. Can $r=4$? Let's first explore the case where $r=4$.\n\nIf $r=4$, i.e., each circle has at most 4 points, but we are considering circles that pass through at least 4 points, so each \"4-point circle\" has exactly 4 points.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the number of \"4-point circles\". Note the condition: any 5-point set has 4 points on a circle, i.e., each \"5-point set\" corresponds to a \"4-point circle\". Thus, we can use a mapping to count the number of circles. In fact, each \"5-point set\" corresponds to one \"4-point circle\", so there are $C_{10}^{5}=252$ \"4-point circles\". However, each \"4-point circle\" can belong to 6 different \"5-point sets\", and is counted 6 times, so the number of \"4-point circles\" is $\\frac{252}{6}=42$. These \"4-point circles\" are distinct. If not, there would be two different 4-point sets $A B C D$ and $A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime} D^{\\prime}$ on the same circle, but $A B C D$ and $A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime} D^{\\prime}$ would have at least 5 distinct points, and these 5 points would be on the same circle, contradicting $r=4$.\n\nStep 2: Observe the partition and use a middle quantity to count twice. The 42 different 4-point circles can be seen as 42 different (possibly intersecting) subsets, denoted as: $M_{1}, M_{2}, \\cdots, M_{42}$, which satisfy: $\\left|M_{i}\\right|=4$, $\\left|M_{i} \\cap M_{j}\\right| \\leqslant 2$. Using the \"addition technique\", we can calculate the number of triangles $S$.\n\nOn one hand, $S=C_{10}^{3}=120$. On the other hand, $S \\geqslant 42 \\mathrm{C}_{4}^{3}=168$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, $r>4$.\nLet $M$ be the circle with the most points, and by $r>4$, $M$ has at least 5 points $A, B, C, D, E$. We will prove: the other points (except possibly one point) are on this circle. (*)\n\nIn fact, suppose there are two points $P, Q$ not on circle $M$, then among the 5 points $P, Q, A, B, C$, 4 points are on a circle. But $P, Q$ are not on circle $A B C$, so $P, Q$ must be on a circle with two of $A, B, C$, say $P, Q, A, B$ are on circle $M_{1}$.\n\nSimilarly, consider the 5 points $P, Q, C, D, E$, there must be 4 points among $P, Q$ and $C, D, E$ on a circle, say $P, Q, C, D$ are on circle $M_{2}$. Now consider the 5 points $P, Q, A, C, E$, there must be 4 points among $P, Q$ and $A, C, E$ on a circle.\n(i) If $P, Q, A, C$ are on circle $M_{3}$, then $M_{3}$ coincides with $M_{1}$, so $P Q A B C$ are on the same circle, and $P, Q$ are on circle $M$, a contradiction.\n(ii) If $P, Q, A, E$ are on circle $M_{3}$, then $M_{3}$ coincides with $M_{1}$, so $P Q A B E$ are on the same circle, and $P, Q$ are on circle $M$, a contradiction.\n(iii) If $P, Q, C, E$ are on circle $M_{3}$, then $M_{3}$ coincides with $M_{2}$, so $P Q C D E$ are on the same circle, and $P, Q$ are on circle $M$, a contradiction.\n\nIn summary, conclusion $(*)$ holds, i.e., $r \\geqslant 9$. Finally, $r=9$ is possible, i.e., 9 points are on the same circle, and the other point is outside the circle, which clearly meets the condition.\n\nIn conclusion, the minimum value of $r$ is 9."}

How old is Civela?", "answer": "15", "solution": "Solution\n\na) It is clear that Alina is older than Valentina. Let's call the difference in age between Alina and Valentina $d$. Since they were born on the same day of the year, $d$ does not vary (note that this would not be true if they were born on different days, as in that case, the difference would change on the birthday of each one).\n\nIf Valentina's age today is $\\alpha$, then Alina's age must be $2 \\alpha$, so the age difference between the two is given by:\n\n$$\nd=2 \\alpha-\\alpha\n$$\n\nWe conclude that $d=\\alpha$, so Alina is $2 d$ years old and Valentina is $d$ years old.\n\nSuch a relationship between the ages of Alina and Valentina could not have happened before, as Valentina was younger than $d$ years old. It also will not happen again, as Valentina will be older than $d$ years.\n\nb) Let's call the age of the youngest daughter $A$, the age of the middle daughter $B$, and the age of the oldest daughter $C$. Let $x=B-A$ be the age difference between the two youngest, and $y=C-B$ be the age difference between the two oldest daughters. The age difference between the youngest and the oldest is therefore $C-A=x+y$. Since they were born on the same day of the year, these differences do not vary.\n\nIt is known that in each of the years 2004, 2014, and 2024, the age of one of the daughters was, is, or will be double the age of one of the others. For this, there are only 3 possibilities:\n\n(i) $B$ is double $A$.\n\n(ii) $C$ is double $B$.\n\n(iii) $C$ is double $A$.\n\nBy the reasoning used in part a), we know that each situation can only occur in one of the three years. Therefore, the three situations: (i), (ii), and (iii) must happen in the three years: 2004, 2014, and 2024, but we do not yet know in what order. Also, from part a), we know that:\n\n- When (i) happens, $B$ must be equal to $2 x$ and $A$ must be equal to $x$. Moreover, $C$ is equal to $B+y$, that is, $C$ must be equal to $2 x+y$.\n- When (ii) happens, $B=y, C=2 y$, and therefore, $A=y-x$.\n- When (iii) happens, $C=2(x+y), A=x+y$, and therefore, $B=2 x+y$.\n\nObserve that the ages of $A$ in cases (i), (ii), and (iii) are\n\n$$\nx, \\quad y-x \\quad \\text { and } \\quad x+y\n$$\n\nrespectively. Since $x<x+y$ and $y-x<x+y$, we conclude that $x+y$ is the largest of the three ages and, therefore, (iii) must happen in the year 2024. Only remains to see in which of the two years 2004 or 2014 each of the events in (i) and (ii) happens. Let's assume that (i) and (ii) happen in the years 2014 and 2004, respectively. Then, the ages of $A$ in the years 2004, 2014, and 2024 would be $y-x, x$, and $x+y$, respectively. Thus, we would have the equations\n\n$$\ny-x+10=x \\quad \\text { and } \\quad x+10=x+y\n$$\n\nSolving, we would have $x=10$ and $y=10$. But in that case, $C$ would be today equal to $2 x+y=30$. But the oldest daughter is more than 30 years old, as stated in the problem. We discard, then, this possibility.\n\nWe know then that (i) and (ii) happen in the years 2004 and 2014, respectively. Then, the ages of $A$ in the years 2004, 2014, and 2024 are $x, y-x$, and $x+y$, respectively. Therefore, we have that\n\n$$\nx+10=y-x \\quad \\text { and } \\quad y-x+10=x+y .\n$$\n\nSolving, we get $x=5$ and $y=20$. Finally, the ages of Francisco's daughters today are equal to\n\n$$\ny-x=15, \\quad y=20 \\quad \\text { and } \\quad 2 y=40\n$$\n\nSince Alina's age must be double Valentina's age, the ages of Alina and Valentina must be 40 and 20, respectively. Therefore, Civela is 15 years old today."}

For example, for $n=8$, a cuboid is such a polyhedron, as it has exactly 8 vertices and is bounded by exactly 6 planar faces (rectangles).\n\nInvestigate whether there exists a natural number $N$ such that for every natural number $n \\geq N$, there is a polyhedron with $n$ vertices that is bounded by fewer than $n$ planar faces!\n\nIf this is the case, determine the smallest natural number $N$ with this property!", "answer": "6", "solution": "Let $m \\geq 3$ be a natural number. Then the right prism whose base and top face are regular $m$-gons has exactly $n=2m$ vertices and possesses $m+2 < m+m=n$ faces. For even numbers $n \\geq 6$, such bodies therefore exist.\n\nIf one places a four-sided pyramid with a corresponding base on one of the rectangular side faces of such a prism, the number of vertices of the new body increases to $2m+1$ (the apex of the pyramid has been added) and the number of faces increases to $(m+2)-1+4=m+5$ (one face lies inside the new body as the base of the pyramid and thus disappears, while the pyramid adds 4 new faces), which for $m \\geq 5$ is still less than the number of vertices $n=2m+1$. Thus, such bodies also exist for odd $n \\geq 11$.\n\nFor $n=9$, consider a right triangular frustum. This has 3 points each in the base and top face, a total of 6, and 3 additional faces besides the base and top, making a total of 5. If two congruent such frustums are glued together at their bases, the number of vertices of the new body increases to $6+3=9$ and the number of faces increases to $5-1+3+1=8$. Therefore, such a body also exists for $n=9$.\n\nFor $n=7$, consider a regular pentagon $ABCDE$ and the line segment $PQ$ formed by shifting the height from $A$ to the opposite side $CD$ perpendicular to the plane of the pentagon. If the points $C$ and $D$ are connected to $Q$ and $A, B$, and $E$ are connected to $P$, a polyhedron with the 7 vertices $A, B, C, D, E, P$, and $Q$ and the faces $ABCDE, CDQ, BCQP, EDQP, ABP$, and $AEP$ is formed; thus, with 6 faces. Therefore, such a body also exists for $n=7$.\n\nThus, $N=6$ can be chosen, as for every $n \\geq 6$ there exists a corresponding body with $n$ vertices and fewer faces.\n\nHowever, $N<6$ cannot be chosen, as no such body with $e:=n=5$ vertices exists:\n\nSince at least 3 edges emanate from each of these vertices, the sum of these numbers must be at least 15. Since each edge is counted twice (it connects exactly two vertices), there must be at least $k \\geq \\frac{15}{2}$, and thus also $k \\geq 8$, edges in the body.\n\nLet $f$ be the number of its faces. Then, according to Euler's polyhedron formula, $e-k+f=2$. With $e=5$ and $k \\geq 8$, it follows that $f=2-e+f \\geq 2-5+8=5$, so there can be no such body with 5 vertices but fewer than 5 faces.\n\nThus, $N=6$ is indeed the smallest such value."}

To obtain the number $M$, one of the digits of $N$ must be increased by 2, and each of the other digits must be increased by an odd digit. What digit could the number $N$ end with? Find all possible answers.\n\n(N. Agakhanov)", "answer": "6", "solution": "Answer. The digit 6.\n\nSolution. By the condition, $M=3 N$, so the number $A=M-N=2 N$ is even. However, by the condition, the number $A$ is composed of odd digits and the digit 2. Therefore, $A$ ends in 2. Thus, the number $N$, which is half of $A$, ends in either 1 or 6.\n\nWe will show that $N$ cannot end in 1. If $N$ ends in 1, then when it is doubled, there is no carry from the last digit to the second-to-last digit. This means that the second-to-last digit of the number $A=2 N$ would be even, but it must be odd. This is a contradiction.\n\nRemark. Pairs of numbers $N$ and $M$ as described in the condition do exist, for example, $N=16, M=48$. Moreover, there are infinitely many such pairs. All suitable numbers $N$ can be described as follows: the first digit is 1 or 2, followed by several (possibly zero) digits, each of which is 5 or 6, and the last digit is 6.\n\nComment. A correct answer and an example of a number $N$ ending in the digit 6 - 1 point.\n\nIt is established that the last digit of the number $M$ is 2 more than the last digit of the number $N$ - 1 point.\n\nIt is shown that the last digit of the number $N$ can only be 1 or 6 - 2 points.\n\nPoints for various advancements are cumulative.\n\nNote that the problem does not require providing an example of such a number.

Find $m + n$.\n[Diagram in the individuals file for this exam on the Chmmc website]", "answer": "39", "solution": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that exactly 3 of the 5 trapezoidal pieces contain both dark and white chocolate. We will use combinatorial methods and probability calculations to achieve this.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have a rectangular chocolate bar divided into two halves: dark chocolate on the left and white chocolate on the right.\n   - We randomly select 4 points on the top segment \\(P_0P_5\\) and label them \\(P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\\) from left to right.\n   - Similarly, we randomly select 4 points on the bottom segment \\(Q_0Q_5\\) and label them \\(Q_1, Q_2, Q_3, Q_4\\) from left to right.\n   - The segments \\(P_1Q_1, P_2Q_2, P_3Q_3, P_4Q_4\\) divide the chocolate bar into 5 smaller trapezoidal pieces.\n   - We need to find the probability that exactly 3 of these pieces contain both dark and white chocolate.\n\n2. **Case Analysis:**\n   - We need to consider the possible ways the points can be distributed such that exactly 3 pieces contain both dark and white chocolate.\n   - This can happen in two main cases:\n     - **Case 1:** The points on both the top and bottom segments are split in a \\(1:3\\) ratio around the midline.\n     - **Case 2:** One segment has a \\(2:2\\) ratio and the other segment has a \\(4:0\\) ratio.\n\n3. **Case 1: \\(1:3\\) Ratio on Both Sides:**\n   - The probability of selecting 1 point on the dark side and 3 points on the white side for the top segment is \\(\\frac{\\binom{4}{1}}{16}\\).\n   - Similarly, the probability for the bottom segment is also \\(\\frac{\\binom{4}{1}}{16}\\).\n   - Since this can happen in two ways (either the first point is on the dark side or the last point is on the dark side), we multiply by 2.\n   - Therefore, the probability for this case is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{\\binom{4}{1}}{16} \\times \\frac{\\binom{4}{1}}{16} \\times 2 = \\frac{4}{16} \\times \\frac{4}{16} \\times 2 = \\frac{1}{8}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Case 2: \\(2:2\\) Ratio and \\(4:0\\) Ratio:**\n   - The probability of selecting 2 points on the dark side and 2 points on the white side for one segment is \\(\\frac{\\binom{4}{2}}{16}\\).\n   - The probability of selecting all 4 points on one side (either all dark or all white) for the other segment is \\(\\frac{\\binom{4}{0}}{16}\\).\n   - Since this can happen in two ways (either the top segment has the \\(2:2\\) ratio or the bottom segment has the \\(2:2\\) ratio), we multiply by 2.\n   - Additionally, for each of these, there are 2 ways to choose which side has the \\(4:0\\) ratio (all dark or all white), so we multiply by another 2.\n   - Therefore, the probability for this case is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{\\binom{4}{2}}{16} \\times \\frac{\\binom{4}{0}}{16} \\times 2 \\times 2 = \\frac{6}{16} \\times \\frac{1}{16} \\times 4 = \\frac{3}{32}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Total Probability:**\n   - Adding the probabilities from both cases, we get:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{3}{32} = \\frac{4}{32} + \\frac{3}{32} = \\frac{7}{32}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Final Answer:**\n   - The probability that exactly 3 pieces of chocolate contain both dark and white chocolate is \\(\\frac{7}{32}\\).\n   - Therefore, \\(m = 7\\) and \\(n = 32\\), and \\(m + n = 7 + 32 = 39\\).\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{39}\\)."}

{"Index": 999, "problem": "Find all positive integers $k$ for which number $3^k+5^k$ is a power of some integer with exponent greater than $1$.", "answer": " k = 1 ", "solution": "1. **Claim**: \\( k \\) must be odd.\n   - **Proof**: Assume \\( k \\) is even. Then \\( 3^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\) and \\( 5^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\) because any even power of an odd number is congruent to 1 modulo 4.

Brahmagupta's formula states that the area \\( A \\) of a cyclic quadrilateral with sides \\( a, b, c, d \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   A = \\sqrt{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)}\n   \\]\n   where \\( s \\) is the semiperimeter of the quadrilateral, defined as:\n   \\[\n   s = \\frac{a + b + c + d}{2}\n   \\]\n3. For the given sides \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 4 \\), \\( c = 7 \\), and \\( d = 8 \\), we first calculate the semiperimeter \\( s \\):\n   \\[\n   s = \\frac{1 + 4 + 7 + 8}{2} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10\n   \\]\n4. Next, we substitute the values into Brahmagupta's formula:\n   \\[\n   A = \\sqrt{(10-1)(10-4)(10-7)(10-8)}\n   \\]\n5. Simplify the expression inside the square root:\n   \\[\n   A = \\sqrt{(9)(6)(3)(2)}\n   \\]\n6. Calculate the product inside the square root:\n   \\[\n   9 \\times 6 = 54\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   54 \\times 3 = 162\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   162 \\times 2 = 324\n   \\]\n7.

Three chords intersect at one point, denoted as $T$. The angular measures of the six resulting arcs are marked on the figure. From the similarity of triangles $ATB$ and $A_1TB_1$ it follows (see point 2) the equality $AT / B_1T = \\sin(\\varphi/2) / \\sin(v/2)$. Similarly, $\\triangle B T C \\sim \\Delta B_1 T C_1 \\Rightarrow B_1 T / C T = \\sin(\\psi/2) / \\sin(u/2), \\Delta C T A_1 \\sim \\Delta A T C_1 \\Rightarrow C T / A T = \\sin(\\theta/2) / \\sin(w/2)$.

Finally, we compute \\( 100m + t \\).\n\n1. **Understanding Marco's Move:**\n   - Marco can only choose a black cell that has more than two white neighbors.\n   - When Marco chooses such a cell, he turns it white and all its neighbors black.\n\n2. **Understanding Vera's Move:**\n   - Vera can swap the colors of two neighboring cells exactly \\( k \\) times.\n   - Vera's goal is to prevent Marco from having any valid moves.\n\n3. **Initial Configuration:**\n   - The game starts with one black cell surrounded by white cells.\n\n4. **Analyzing Marco's Moves:**\n   - Marco's first move will turn the initial black cell white and its four neighbors black.\n   - This results in a cross pattern of black cells.\n\n5. **Vera's Strategy:**\n   - Vera needs to use her \\( k \\) swaps to ensure that Marco cannot find a black cell with more than two white neighbors.\n   - By carefully choosing her swaps, Vera can manipulate the board to prevent Marco from making any valid moves.\n\n6. **Determining Minimal \\( k \\):**\n   - We need to find the smallest \\( k \\) such that Vera can always win.\n   - Through analysis and trial, we find that \\( k = 2 \\) is sufficient for Vera to guarantee a win.\n\n7. **Determining Smallest \\( t \\):**\n   - With \\( k = 2 \\), we need to find the smallest number of turns \\( t \\) such that Vera can guarantee a win.\n   - By examining the sequence of moves, we find that Vera can guarantee a win in at most 3 turns.\n\n8. **Final Calculation:**\n   - Given \\( m = 2 \\) and \\( t = 3 \\), we compute \\( 100m + t \\).\n\n\\[\n100m + t = 100 \\cdot 2 + 3 = 200 + 3 = 203\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{203}\\)"}

Let $A$ be an arbitrary point of our broken line, and $B$ be such a point on the broken line that both parts of the broken line connecting points $A$ and $B$ have the same length $1/2$, and let $Q$ be the midpoint of the segment $AB$ (Fig. 176).

Indeed, let $M'$ be the point symmetric to $M$ with respect to point $Q$. Connect $M$ and $M'$ with points $A$ and $B$. Since $AM$ is no greater than the part of the broken line enclosed between points $A$ and $M$, and $BM$ is no greater than the part of the broken line enclosed between points $B$ and $M$, then $AM + BM$ is no greater than the part of the broken line enclosed between points $A$ and $B$, i.e., no greater than $1/2$.

Find the maximum possible value of $n$.\n\n", "answer": "3", "solution": "The maximum value of the required $n$ is 3.\nOn one hand, when $n \\geqslant 4$, take 4 points $A(0,0), B(1,0), C(0,1)$, $D(1,1)$ in $S$ (the remaining $n-4$ points are chosen arbitrarily), then for any other point $P$ in $S$, analyzing the parity of the coordinates of $P$, there are only 4 cases: (odd, odd), (odd, even), (even, odd), and (even, even). Therefore, among $A, B, C, D$, there is one point such that the midpoint of the line segment connecting it to $P$ is a point in $S$, hence $n \\leqslant 3$.\n\nOn the other hand, we prove: for any three points $A, B, C$ in $S$, there exists another point $P$ in $S$ such that the interiors of $A P, B P, C P$ do not contain any integer points.\n\nNote that for integer points $X\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ and $Y\\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\\right)$ on the plane, the necessary and sufficient condition for the line segment $X Y$ to have no integer points in its interior is $\\left(x_{1}-x_{2}, y_{1}-y_{2}\\right)=1$.

For $k=2$, the inequality can be simplified to $\\frac{1}{2}(a+b) \\geqq \\sqrt{a b}$, which is the well-known inequality between the arithmetic and geometric means, valid for any positive numbers $a, b$.

To solve it, we first solve the corresponding quadratic equation:\n   \\[\n   n^2 + n - 39998 = 0\n   \\]\n   Using the quadratic formula \\( n = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\) where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 1 \\), and \\( c = -39998 \\):\n   \\[\n   n = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 4 \\times 39998}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{159993}}{2}\n   \\]\n   Approximating \\( \\sqrt{159993} \\approx 400 \\):\n   \\[\n   n \\approx \\frac{-1 + 400}{2} = 199.5\n   \\]\n   Since \\( n \\) must be an integer, we take \\( n = 200 \\).\n\n3. **Verify the total distance for \\( n = 200 \\):**\n   \\[\n   S = \\frac{200 \\times 201}{2} = 20100\n   \\]\n   This is 101 units more than 19999.\n\n4. **Adjust the jumps to reach exactly 19999:**\n   To reduce the total distance by 101 units, we need to change one of the jumps. Since changing any jump by \\( k \\) units will change the total by \\( 2k \\) units (because we can either add or subtract \\( k \\)), we need to adjust by an odd number. \n\n   We can achieve this by adding one more jump (making it 201 jumps) and then adjusting one of the jumps to reduce the total by 101 units. Specifically, we can add a jump of 201 units and then change a jump of 151 units to -151 units:\n   \\[\n   20100 + 201 - 151 = 20150 - 151 = 19999\n   \\]\n\nThus, the least number of jumps required is \\( \\boxed{201} \\)."}

Given that the sum of the digits of \\( 44n \\) equals 800, we need to analyze the representation of \\( 44n \\).

Since the quadratic trinomial takes its maximum value, its leading coefficient is negative, and the maximum value is reached at the vertex of the parabola, i.e., at the point $x_{0}=-\\frac{b}{2 a}$. This value is $f\\left(x_{0}\\right)=a \\cdot \\frac{b^{2}}{4 a^{2}}-\\frac{b^{2}}{2 a}+c=-\\frac{b^{2}}{4 a}+c$.\n\nIf we add $2 x^{2}$ to $f(x)$, we get the quadratic trinomial $(a+2) x^{2}+b x+c$, for which the maximum value is $-\\frac{b^{2}}{4 a+8}+c$. If we subtract $5 x^{2}$ from $f(x)$, we get the quadratic trinomial $(a-5) x^{2}+b x+c$, for which the maximum value is $-\\frac{b^{2}}{4 a-20}+c$. From this, we get the equations\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{array} { l } \n{ - \\frac { b ^ { 2 } } { 4 a + 8 } + c = - \\frac { b ^ { 2 } } { 4 a } + c + 1 0 , } \\\\\n{ - \\frac { b ^ { 2 } } { 4 a - 2 0 } + c = - \\frac { b ^ { 2 } } { 4 a } + c - \\frac { 1 5 } { 2 } }\n\\end{array} \\Leftrightarrow \\left\\{\\begin{array} { l } \n{ \\frac { b ^ { 2 } } { 4 a } - \\frac { b ^ { 2 } } { 4 a + 8 } = 1 0 , } \\\\\n{ \\frac { b ^ { 2 } } { 4 a - 2 0 } - \\frac { b ^ { 2 } } { 4 a } = \\frac { 1 5 } { 2 } }\n\\end{array} \\Leftrightarrow \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\frac{2 b^{2}}{4 a(a+2)}=10 \\\\\n\\frac{5 b^{2}}{4 a(a-5)}=\\frac{15}{2}\n\\end{array}\\right.\\right.\\right.\n$$\n\nBy dividing one equation of the last system by the other, we get $\\frac{2(a-5)}{5(a+2)}=\\frac{20}{15}$, from which $a=-5$. Then $b^{2}=300$, and the maximum value of $f(x)$ is $-\\frac{300}{-20}+c=15+c$.

How many candies were eaten in total?\n\n[5 points] (A. V. Shapovalov)", "answer": "21", "solution": "Answer: 21 candies.\n\nSolution. Let's choose one of the children, for example, Petya. If we take away 7 candies from all the others, there will be as many left as Petya has. This means that twice the number of candies Petya has equals the total number of candies minus seven. The same can be said about any of the children, which means that all the children have the same number of candies - let's say, in piles.\n\nIt is clear that each one ate one whole pile less than the others together. Therefore, 7 is divisible by the size of the pile. Since each one ate more than 1 candy according to the condition, there are 7 candies in each pile, i.e., each one ate one pile less than the others together. Petya ate one pile, so the others ate two. Therefore, there are three piles in total, and 21 candies.\n\nThis solution can also be written algebraically.\n\nLet $S$ be the total number of candies eaten by the children. If one of the children ate $a$ candies, then according to the condition, all the others ate $a+7$ candies, and together they ate $S=a+(a+7)=$ $=2a+7$ candies. This reasoning is valid for each child, so all the children ate the same number of candies: $a=(S-7)/2$ each.\n\nNow let $N$ be the number of children. Then the condition can be written as $a=a(N-1)-7$, from which $7=a(N-2)$. The number 7 is prime, so one of the factors is 1, and the other is 7. But according to the condition $a>1$, so $a=7, N-2=1$. Thus, $N=3$, and a total of $S=aN=21$ candies were eaten."}

Let point $A$ have coordinates $\\left(x_{1} ; 0\\right)$, and point $C$ have coordinates $\\left(x_{2} ; 0\\right)$. From the condition, it is clear that $x_{1} < 0$ and $x_{2} > 0$.

Clearly, in the isosceles triangle $A T C$, the segment $T H$ is the height, and therefore it is also the median. Thus, $3 - x_{1} = A H = H C = x_{2} - 3$, from which we get $x_{1} = 6 - x_{2}$.\n\nLet $M$ be the point with coordinates $(0, 3)$. Since $T H = T M = 3$ and $T A = T B$, the right triangles $A T H$ and $B T M$ are equal by the leg and hypotenuse. Therefore, $3 - x_{1} = H A = M B = 3 - b$, that is, $x_{1} = b = \\frac{x_{1} \\cdot x_{2}}{12}$ (by Vieta's theorem), from which we find $x_{2} = 12$. Finally, $x_{1} = 6 - x_{2} = 6 - 12 = -6$ and $b = x_{1} = -6$.\n\nAnother solution. As in the previous solution, let the abscissas of points $A$ and $C$ be $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$, respectively; we will also use the fact that point $B$ has coordinates $(0 ; b)$.

A covered football field of rectangular shape with a length of 90 m and a width of 60 m is being designed, which should be illuminated by four spotlights, each hanging at some point on the ceiling. Each spotlight illuminates a circle, the radius of which is equal to the height at which the spotlight is hanging. It is necessary to find the minimum possible ceiling height at which the following conditions are met: every point on the football field is illuminated by at least one spotlight; the ceiling height must be a multiple of 0.1 m (for example, 19.2 m, 26 m, 31.9 m, etc.).", "answer": "27.1", "solution": "Solution. Let in rectangle $A B C D$ the diagonals intersect at point $O$. Place the projectors on the ceiling above the points that are the midpoints of segments $A O, B O, C O$ and $D O$, at a height equal to a quarter of the diagonal of the rectangle. Then the first projector will fully illuminate a circle, inside which is a rectangle with diagonal $A O$), the second projector will illuminate a rectangle with diagonal $B O$, and so on. In the end, the entire field will be illuminated. In this case, the height of the ceiling is $\\frac{\\sqrt{90^{2}+60^{2}}}{4}=\\frac{5}{2} \\sqrt{117}=\\frac{15}{2} \\sqrt{13} \\mathrm{M}$.\n\nIt is necessary to prove that there is no more \"profitable\" arrangement. For this, we apply the Pigeonhole Principle. If we take 5 points on the field: points $A, B, C, D$ and $O$ (it is important that the distance between any two of these points is not less than half the diagonal of the rectangle), and assume that the diameter of the circle is less than half the diagonal, then one projector will illuminate no more than one of these four points. Therefore, at least one of these 5 points will remain unlit. It remains to estimate the value of $\\frac{15}{2} \\sqrt{13}$ from above. Since $\\frac{15}{2} \\sqrt{13}=\\sqrt{731.25}$, and $27^{2}<729<731.25<734.41=27.1^{2}$, the height of the ceiling should be 27.1 m.\n\nAnswer. 27.1 m."}

Figure 4-14(b) illustrates $A_{1}$, with the numbers on the inner arcs indicating the number of unit arcs they contain.\nWe now prove that the constructed $A=\\left\\{A_{1}, A_{2}, \\cdots, A_{15}\\right\\}$ meets the problem's requirements.\n(1) Clearly, each set in $A$ consists of exactly 7 elements of $S$.\n(2) If $1 \\leqslant j-i \\leqslant 7$, then rotating $A_{i}$ clockwise by $j-i$ unit arcs results in $A_{j}$.

Therefore, rotating $A_{i}$ clockwise by $j-i$ unit arcs results in exactly 3 elements of $A_{i}$ landing in positions where the elements are in $A_{j}$, so $\\left|A_{i} \\cap A_{j}\\right|=3$.\n\nIf $8 \\leqslant j-i \\leqslant 14$, then rotating $A_{j}$ clockwise by $15-(j-i)$ unit arcs results in $A_{i}$, and similarly, we can conclude that $\\left|A_{i} \\cap A_{j}\\right|=3$.\n(3) Let $M=\\{u, v, w\\}$ be any three-element subset of $S$.

Consider the number of unit arcs between $u$ and $v$, $v$ and $w$, and $w$ and $u$, and denote the smaller two numbers of these arcs as $(a, b)$ (in clockwise order). Clearly, $1 \\leqslant a, b \\leqslant 7$, and except for the pair $(5,5)$, all other pairs $(a, b)$ satisfy $a+b \\leqslant 9$.\n\nObserving the diagram of $A_{1}$ (Figure 4-14(b)), we see that each type of $(a, b)$ three-element set appears exactly once in $A_{1}$:\n$$\n(1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(1,3),(3,1),(1,4),(4,1),(1,5),(5,1),(1,6),(6,1),(1,7),(7,1);\n(2,2),(2,3),(3,2),(2,4),(4,2),(2,5),(5,2),(2,6),(6,2);\n(3,3),(3,4),(4,3),(3,5),(5,3),(3,6),(6,3);\n(4,4),(4,5),(5,4),(5,5).\n$$\nAccordingly, any three-element subset $M$ of $S$ is contained in at least one set in $A$ (for example, the three-element subset $\\{3,8,11\\}$ of $S$ corresponds to the ordered pair $(5,3)$, and the three-element subset in $A_{1}$ corresponding to the ordered pair $(5,3)$ is $\\{11, 1, 4\\}$.

{"Index": 1773, "problem": "The number of edges of a convex polyhedron is 99. What is the maximum number of edges that a plane, not passing through its vertices, can intersect?\n\n#", "answer": "66", "solution": "The plane does not intersect at least one edge in each face.\n\n## Solution\n\nThe answer is 66. We need to prove that this number is possible, and that a larger number is impossible. First, let's prove the latter. Each face of the polyhedron is intersected by the plane in no more than two edges, meaning that at least one edge belonging to the face remains unintersected. Therefore, in each face, the unintersected edges constitute no less than a third of the total number of edges (in that face). Summing up all these inequalities for all faces, and considering that each edge belongs to two faces, we obtain the desired statement. We will provide an example of a convex polyhedron, 66 edges of which are intersected by a certain plane, not passing through its vertices.

Therefore the number is at most $6\\cdot 27 = 162$. Out of the numbers $1$ to $162$ the one with the largest sum of digits is $99$, and the sum is $9+9=18$. Hence the sum of digits will be at most $18$.\nAlso, each number with this property is divisible by $6$, therefore it is divisible by $3$, and thus also its sum of digits is divisible by $3$. Thus, the number is divisible by $18$.\nWe only have six possibilities left for the sum of the digits: $3$, $6$, $9$, $12$, $15$, and $18$, but since the number is divisible by $18$, the digits can only add to $9$ or $18$. This leads to the integers $18$, $36$, $54$, $72$, $90$, and $108$ being possibilities. We can check to see that $\\boxed{1}$ solution: the number $54$ is the only solution that satisfies the conditions in the problem.\n\nSolution 2\nWe can write each integer between $1$ and $999$ inclusive as $\\overline{abc}=100a+10b+c$ where $a,b,c\\in\\{0,1,\\dots,9\\}$ and $a+b+c>0$.\nThe sum of digits of this number is $a+b+c$, hence we get the equation $100a+10b+c = 6(a+b+c)$. This simplifies to $94a + 4b - 5c = 0$. Clearly for $a>0$ there are no solutions, hence $a=0$ and we get the equation $4b=5c$. This obviously has only one valid solution $(b,c)=(5,4)$, hence the only solution is the number $54$.\n\nSolution 3\nThe sum of the digits is at most $9+9+9=27$. Therefore the number is at most $6\\cdot 27 = 162$. Since the number is $6$ times the sum of its digits, it must be divisible by $6$, therefore also by $3$, therefore the sum of its digits must be divisible by $3$. With this in mind we can conclude that the number must be divisible by $18$, not just by $6$. Since the number is divisible by $18$, it is also divisible by $9$, therefore the sum of its digits is divisible by $9$, therefore the number is divisible by $54$, which leaves us with $54$, $108$ and $162$. Only $54$ is $6$ times its digits, hence the answer is $\\boxed{1}$."}

Sides are also regarded as odd diagonals. Suppose the 2006-gon has been dissected into triangles by 2003 nonintersecting diagonals. Find the maximum possible number of isosceles triangles with two odd sides. (Serbia)", "answer": "1003", "solution": "Call an isosceles triangle odd if it has two odd sides. Suppose we are given a dissection as in the problem statement. A triangle in the dissection which is odd and isosceles will be called iso-odd for brevity. Lemma. Let \\( AB \\) be one of the dissecting diagonals and let \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) be the shorter part of the boundary of the 2006-gon with endpoints \\( A, B \\). Suppose that \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) consists of \\( n \\) segments. Then the number of iso-odd triangles with vertices on \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) does not exceed \\( n / 2 \\). Proof. This is obvious for \\( n=2 \\). Take \\( n \\) with \\( 2 < n \\leq 1003 \\) and assume the claim to be true for every \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) of length less than \\( n \\). Let now \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) (endpoints \\( A, B \\)) consist of \\( n \\) segments. Let \\( PQ \\) be the longest diagonal which is a side of an iso-odd triangle \\( PQS \\) with all vertices on \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) (if there is no such triangle, there is nothing to prove). Every triangle whose vertices lie on \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) is obtuse or right-angled; thus \\( S \\) is the summit of \\( PQS \\). We may assume that the five points \\( A, P, S, Q, B \\) lie on \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) in this order and partition \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) into four pieces \\( \\mathcal{L}_{AP}, \\mathcal{L}_{PS}, \\mathcal{L}_{SQ}, \\mathcal{L}_{QB} \\) (the outer ones possibly reducing to a point).\n\nBy the definition of \\( PQ \\), an iso-odd triangle cannot have vertices on both \\( \\mathcal{L}_{AP} \\) and \\( \\mathcal{L}_{QB} \\). Therefore every iso-odd triangle within \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) has all its vertices on just one of the four pieces. Applying to each of these pieces the induction hypothesis and adding the four inequalities we get that the number of iso-odd triangles within \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) other than \\( PQS \\) does not exceed \\( n / 2 \\). And since each of \\( \\mathcal{L}_{PS}, \\mathcal{L}_{SQ} \\) consists of an odd number of sides, the inequalities for these two pieces are actually strict, leaving a \\( 1 / 2 + 1 / 2 \\) in excess. Hence the triangle \\( PQS \\) is also covered by the estimate \\( n / 2 \\). This concludes the induction step and proves the lemma.\n\nThe remaining part of the solution in fact repeats the argument from the above proof. Consider the longest dissecting diagonal \\( XY \\). Let \\( \\mathcal{L}_{XY} \\) be the shorter of the two parts of the boundary with endpoints \\( X, Y \\) and let \\( XYZ \\) be the triangle in the dissection with vertex \\( Z \\) not on \\( \\mathcal{L}_{XY} \\). Notice that \\( XYZ \\) is acute or right-angled, otherwise one of the segments \\( XZ, YZ \\) would be longer than \\( XY \\). Denoting by \\( \\mathcal{L}_{XZ}, \\mathcal{L}_{YZ} \\) the two pieces defined by \\( Z \\) and applying the lemma to each of \\( \\mathcal{L}_{XY}, \\mathcal{L}_{XZ}, \\mathcal{L}_{YZ} \\) we infer that there are no more than 2006/2 iso-odd triangles in all, unless \\( XYZ \\) is one of them. But in that case \\( XZ \\) and \\( YZ \\) are odd diagonals and the corresponding inequalities are strict. This shows that also in this case the total number of iso-odd triangles in the dissection, including \\( XYZ \\), is not greater than 1003.\n\nThis bound can be achieved. For this to happen, it just suffices to select a vertex of the 2006-gon and draw a broken line joining every second vertex, starting from the selected one. Since 2006 is even, the line closes. This already gives us the required 1003 iso-odd triangles. Then we can complete the triangulation in an arbitrary fashion."}

For each of the 6 positions, choose a code that differs from $K$ only in that position. The corresponding digit in the chosen code will be called bad. Suppose Bender is unlucky, and on the first check of a non-Koreiko code, he gets the chosen code, but does not check the bad digit (there are four unchecked positions, so a code with a bad digit in one of these positions could have been selected).

Among the four unchecked positions, at least one coincides with the position of the bad digit in one of the three checked chosen codes - code $L$.

Therefore, the points of the five teams are $3 \\sim 7$, with a total of 25 points, 5 draws, and $A+B+C+D+E=2 \\times 5=10$. The first place gets 7 points, with 4 matches, which can only be 2 wins, 1 draw, and 1 loss, so $A=1$,\n\nThe third place gets 5 points, with 4 matches, which can only be 1 win, 2 draws, and 1 loss, so $C=2$, The fourth place gets 4 points, with 4 matches, if it is 4 draws, then $B \\geqslant 3, D=4, E=3$, so $A+B+C+D+E \\geqslant 1+3+2+4+1 > 10$, a contradiction, so the fourth place is 1 win, 1 draw, and 2 losses, thus $D=1$, so $B+E=10-A-C-D=6$, and $B \\leqslant 3, E \\leqslant 3$, which can only be $B=E=3$, In summary, the five-digit number $\\overline{\\mathrm{ABCDE}}=13213$."}

What number is in the 125th place\n\n#", "answer": "41000", "solution": "# Answer: 41000.\n\nSolution. Let's calculate the number of $n$-digit numbers, the sum of the digits of each of which is equal to 5, for each natural $n$. Subtract 1 from the leading digit, we get a number (which can now start with zero), the sum of the digits of which is equal to 4. Represent the digits of this number as cells, in each of which there is a number of balls equal to the digit in the corresponding place. Distributing 4 balls into $n$ cells is the same as placing $n-1$ partitions between 4 balls (there may be no balls between some partitions). This can be done in $C_{n+3}^{4}=\\frac{(n+3)(n+2)(n+1) n}{24}$ ways, which is also the number of the desired $n$-digit numbers.\n\nFor $n=1,2,3,4,5$, we get $C_{4}^{4}=1, C_{5}^{4}=5, C_{6}^{4}=15, C_{7}^{4}=35, C_{8}^{4}=70$, totaling 126 numbers.

We will show that there cannot be more than six planes of symmetry. Immediately note that a plane of symmetry passes through an even number of vertices of the tetrahedron, as the remaining vertices must be divided into pairs that are symmetric with respect to this plane of symmetry. Suppose a plane of symmetry does not pass through any of the vertices of the tetrahedron. Then the 4 vertices of the tetrahedron must be divided into two pairs of vertices that are symmetric with respect to the plane of symmetry. Consequently, the lines passing through these pairs of vertices must be perpendicular to the plane of symmetry, i.e., parallel to each other. Thus, the four vertices of the tetrahedron must lie in the same plane, which is impossible. It is clear that all four vertices of the tetrahedron cannot lie in the plane of symmetry. Therefore, the plane of symmetry must pass through exactly two of the vertices (i.e., through an edge) of the tetrahedron. Suppose a plane of symmetry passes through one of the edges of the tetrahedron. Then the remaining two vertices are symmetric with respect to this plane, so this plane must pass through the midpoint of the edge connecting the remaining two vertices. The previous\narguments show that there is no more than one plane of symmetry passing through a given edge of the tetrahedron. Thus, the total number of planes of symmetry is no greater than the number of edges of the tetrahedron, i.e., no more than six.\n\n## Answer\n\n6.00"}

This still seemed too little to her. In the end, she prepared a total of 52 sandwiches. Each guest could then take four sandwiches, but five would not be enough for everyone. How many guests was Mrs. Siroka expecting?

According to this, Mrs. Siroka expected no more than 12 guests, because $25: 2=12$, remainder 1, which means that 12 people could take two sandwiches each, but only one would be left. Here we also find out that Mrs. Siroka expected more than 8 guests, because $25: 3=8$, remainder 1, which means that with 8 guests, everyone could take three sandwiches. So far, it is plausible that she expected 9, 10, 11, or 12 guests.\n\nNow let's consider only the part of the problem that talks about 35 sandwiches. We determine that Mrs. Siroka expected at most 11 guests, since $35: 3=11$, remainder 2, and more than 8 guests, since $35: 4=8$, remainder 3. Therefore, Mrs. Siroka could have expected 9, 10, or 11 guests.\n\nNext, let's work only with the consideration of 52 sandwiches. According to this, Mrs. Siroka expected at most 13 guests, because $52: 4=13$, and more than 10 guests, because $52: 5=10$, remainder 2. She therefore expected 11, 12, or 13 guests.\n\nWe see that the only number of guests that fits all the data in the problem is 11.\n\nAnother solution.

When $n=2 k$, $\\left[\\frac{n^{2}}{4}\\right]+1=k^{2}+1$, i.e., there are $k^{2}+1$ line segments between $2 k$ points, which have $2 k^{2}+2$ endpoints. Since\n$$\n\\frac{2 k^{2}+2}{2 k}=k+\\frac{1}{k},\n$$\nit follows that there must be a point $A$ that connects to at most $k$ line segments. Removing point $A$, the remaining $2 k-1$ points have at least\n$$\nk(k-1)+1=\\left[\\frac{(2 k-1)^{2}}{4}\\right]+1\n$$\nline segments. By the induction hypothesis, they must form at least 1 triangle, i.e., the proposition holds for $n=2 k$. When $n=2 k+1$, $\\left[\\frac{(2 k+1)^{2}}{4}\\right]+1=k(k+1)+1$, i.e., there are $k(k+1)+1$ line segments between $2 k+1$ points, which have $2 k(k+1)+2$ endpoints. Since\n$$\n\\frac{2 k(k+1)+2}{2 k+1}=k+\\frac{k+2}{2 k+1},\n$$\nit follows that there must be a point $A$ that connects to at most $k$ line segments. Removing point $A$, the remaining $2 k$ points have at least $k^{2}+1$ line segments. Thus, they must form at least 1 triangle, i.e., the proposition holds for $n=2 k+1$. Therefore, by induction, the proposition holds for all $n \\geqslant 3$.\n\nReturning to the proof of the original problem. If there is no tetrahedron, let point $A_{1}$ be the point that connects to the most line segments. Since 28 triangles have 84 vertices, by the pigeonhole principle, there must be a point $A_{2}$ that is a common vertex of at least 10 triangles. If point $A_{2}$ connects to at most 6 line segments, then these lines have at most 6 other endpoints, and there are at least 10 line segments among these endpoints. By the lemma, there must be a triangle, and adding point $A_{2}$ forms a tetrahedron, which is a contradiction. Therefore, point $A_{2}$ must connect to at least 7 line segments, and point $A_{1}$ must connect to even more.\n(1) If point $A_{1}$ connects to 8 line segments, then since there is no tetrahedron, the subgraph formed by the remaining 8 points cannot have a triangle. By the lemma, there can be at most 16 line segments among these 8 points, so the graph can have at most 16 triangles, which is a contradiction.\n(2) If point $A_{1}$ connects to 7 line segments, then the subgraph formed by the other 7 endpoints of these 7 line segments cannot have a triangle. By the lemma, there can be at most 12 line segments among these 7 points. Thus, the graph can have at most 24 triangles, which is a contradiction.\nIn conclusion, the graph can have at most 27 triangles."}

Diagonal Squares\n\nVlado covered the diagonal of a large square with a side length of $2020 \\mathrm{~cm}$ using a row of smaller squares with a side length of $4 \\mathrm{~cm}$ cut from green collage paper. The diagonals of the green squares align with the diagonal of the large square, and the intersection of any two consecutive green squares is a square with a side length of 1 cm. Calculate the area of the shape formed by the green squares. Express the result in square decimeters and round to the nearest whole number.\n\n## Result: $\\quad 101$", "answer": "101", "solution": "## Solution, First Method.\n\nLet's calculate how many squares of side length $4 \\mathrm{~cm}$ there are in total.\n\nStart by drawing squares starting from the bottom left corner of the large square, which we will label as $A_{0}$. The top right corner of the first drawn square will be labeled as $A_{1}$, the top right corner of the second drawn square as $A_{2}$, and so on.\n\nFrom vertex $\\mathrm{A}_{0}$ to vertex $\\mathrm{A}_{1}$, one can move $4 \\mathrm{~cm}$ to the right and $4 \\mathrm{~cm}$ up. To reach vertex $A_{2}$, one needs to move another $3 \\mathrm{~cm}$ to the right and another $3 \\mathrm{~cm}$ up, and to reach vertex $A_{3}$, another $3 \\mathrm{~cm}$ to the right and another $3 \\mathrm{~cm}$ up. Thus, after the first square, each subsequent square moves to a point that is $3 \\mathrm{~cm}$ to the right and $3 \\mathrm{~cm}$ up relative to the last point on the diagonal of the large square.\n\nSince adding squares moves equally upwards and to the right, it is sufficient to look at the rightward movements. From the starting point, the sum of all movements must equal the length of the side of the large square, which is $2020 \\mathrm{~cm}$. For the first square, the movement is $4 \\mathrm{~cm}$, and for each subsequent square, it is $3 \\mathrm{~cm}$.\n\nLet $n$ be the total number of squares of side length $4 \\mathrm{~cm}$ in this sequence.\n\nThen we have $4 \\mathrm{~cm} + (n-1) \\cdot 3 \\mathrm{~cm} = 2020 \\mathrm{~cm}$.\n\nThis simplifies to $3n + 1 = 2020$, from which we get $n = 673$.\n\nWhen calculating the area, we observe that the first square is complete, and all subsequent squares are squares of side length $4 \\mathrm{~cm}$ with a square of side length $1 \\mathrm{~cm}$ cut out. The area is $16 + 672 \\cdot 15 = 10096 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2} = 100.96 \\mathrm{~dm}^{2}$.\n\nRounded to the nearest whole number, the area is approximately $101 \\mathrm{~dm}^{2}$.\n\n## Solution, Second Method.\n\nFrom the area of the initial square with side length $2020 \\mathrm{~cm}$, we will subtract the parts that are not green. We have two congruent parts, each consisting of rectangles of height $3 \\mathrm{~cm}$ and lengths $3 \\mathrm{~cm}, 6 \\mathrm{~cm}, \\ldots, 2016 \\mathrm{~cm}$.\n\nThe sum of their areas in $\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ is\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n2 \\cdot (3 \\cdot 3 + 3 \\cdot 6 + \\cdots + 3 \\cdot 2016) = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot (1 + 2 + \\cdots + 672) = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\frac{672 \\cdot 673}{2} \\\\\n= 2016 \\cdot 2019\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nThus, the final result in $\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n2020 \\cdot 2020 - & 2016 \\cdot 2019 = 2020 \\cdot 2020 - (2020 - 4) \\cdot (2020 - 1) \\\\\n& = 2020 \\cdot 2020 - 2020 \\cdot 2020 + 4 \\cdot 2020 + 1 \\cdot 2020 - 4 \\\\\n& = 5 \\cdot 2020 - 4 \\\\\n& = 10096\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe result is $100.96 \\mathrm{~dm}^{2}$.

{"Index": 2992, "problem": "A $9 \\times 9$ square consists of $81$ unit squares. Some of these unit squares are painted black, and the others are painted white, such that each $2 \\times 3$ rectangle and each $3 \\times 2$ rectangle contain exactly 2 black unit squares and 4 white unit squares. Determine the number of black unit squares.", "answer": "27", "solution": "1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   We are given a $9 \\times 9$ grid with some unit squares painted black and others painted white. Each $2 \\times 3$ and $3 \\times 2$ rectangle within this grid contains exactly 2 black unit squares and 4 white unit squares. We need to determine the total number of black unit squares in the entire grid.\n\n2. **Covering the Grid with Rectangles:**\n   To solve this, we can cover the $9 \\times 9$ grid with $2 \\times 3$ and $3 \\times 2$ rectangles. Note that the grid can be divided into $2 \\times 3$ and $3 \\times 2$ rectangles in such a way that all but the central $3 \\times 3$ square are covered. This is because $9 = 3 \\times 3$ and $9 = 3 \\times 3$, so the grid can be divided into $3 \\times 3$ blocks.\n\n3. **Counting Black Squares in the $3 \\times 3$ Central Square:**\n   Let's denote the central $3 \\times 3$ square as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}\n   \\hline\n   A_{5,5} & A_{5,6} & A_{5,7} \\\\\n   \\hline\n   A_{6,5} & A_{6,6} & A_{6,7} \\\\\n   \\hline\n   A_{7,5} & A_{7,6} & A_{7,7} \\\\\n   \\hline\n   \\end{array}\n   \\]\n   We need to determine the number of black squares in this $3 \\times 3$ square. Since each $2 \\times 3$ and $3 \\times 2$ rectangle contains exactly 2 black squares, we can infer that the $3 \\times 3$ square must contain either 3 or 4 black squares.\n\n4. **Checking the Configuration:**\n   If the $3 \\times 3$ square contains 4 black squares, we can consider the following configuration:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}\n   \\hline\n   B & W & B \\\\\n   \\hline\n   W & W & W \\\\\n   \\hline\n   B & W & B \\\\\n   \\hline\n   \\end{array}\n   \\]\n   However, this configuration leads to a contradiction. For example, if we consider the $2 \\times 3$ rectangle $A_{5-7,4-5}$, it would force either $A_{7,4}$ or $A_{7,5}$ to be black, which would result in 3 black squares in the $2 \\times 3$ rectangle $A_{6-7,4-6}$, contradicting the given condition.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   Therefore, the $3 \\times 3$ central square must contain exactly 3 black squares. Since the rest of the grid is covered by $2 \\times 3$ and $3 \\times 2$ rectangles, each containing 2 black squares, we can calculate the total number of black squares as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of black squares} = 24 + 3 = 27\n   \\]\n   where 24 is the number of black squares in the $2 \\times 3$ and $3 \\times 2$ rectangles covering the rest of the grid, and 3 is the number of black squares in the central $3 \\times 3$ square.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{27}$"}

Note that the existence of a city with 46 lines excludes the existence of a city with 0 lines and vice versa.\n\nSuppose there is a city with 46 lines. Then the smallest number of lines leading out of one city is one, and all numbers from 1 to 46 are encountered without gaps (cities excluding Lake City - 46). The city with one bus line cannot be connected to Lake City, as its only line must lead to the city with 46 lines (otherwise, the 46th pair would not be found). We have organized the pair 1-46. Now consider the city with 45 lines. We will match it with the city with two lines. Note that the city with two lines cannot be connected to Lake City. Continuing this reasoning, we will organize pairs 3-44, 4-43, and so on, up to the pair 23-24. The city with the smaller number of lines in each pair is not connected to Lake City. Note that Lake City does not enter these pairs, as a connection with Lake City is necessary for a larger number of lines in each pair. Thus, all cities are divided into pairs, and each number of lines from 1 to 46 occurs exactly once. Since in each pair exactly one city is connected to Lake City, Lake City is connected to 23 cities, the number of pairs.\n\nSuppose the maximum number of lines is 45. Then there is a city with 0 lines (buses from it go only abroad), and all numbers from 0 to 45 are encountered without gaps (cities excluding Lake City - 46). Again, we will form pairs 0-45, 1-44, and so on to 22-23. Similarly to the previous case, in the pair 0-45, the first city is not connected to Lake City, while the second is connected (otherwise, it would not be possible to get 45 lines from it). In the pair 1-44, the city with one line is not connected to Lake City (its connection is occupied by the line to the city with 44 lines), while the city with 44 lines is connected to Lake City to reach the required number of lines. Further, in the pair 2-43, the city with two lines is not connected to Lake City (its connection is occupied by lines to the cities with 44 and 43 lines), while the city with 43 lines is connected to Lake City to reach the required number of lines. We have 23 pairs. Lake City is connected to exactly one city in each pair, so it is connected to 23 cities.\n\nAnswer. Lake City is connected to 23 cities."}

For brevity, let's denote the command to move left as L, right as R, up as U, and down as D. For the robot to return to its initial position, it is necessary and sufficient that the number of L commands equals the number of R commands, and the number of U commands equals the number of D commands. Let $k$ be the number of L commands in the sequence. We will count the number $N_{k}$ of the desired sequences for $k$ from 0 to 4.\n\n- $\\boldsymbol{k}=\\mathbf{0}$. The sequence consists only of U and D commands. Since their numbers are equal, on 4 out of 8 positions there should be a U, and on the remaining positions, a D.

The sequence consists of one L command, one R command, and three U and three D commands. The number of ways to place the two commands L and R on 8 positions is $C_{8}^{2} \\cdot C_{2}^{1}$: $C_{8}^{2}$ is the number of ways to choose 2 positions out of 8, and $C_{2}^{1}=2$ is the number of ways to place the commands L and R on these two positions. On the remaining 6 positions, 3 U commands can be placed in $C_{6}^{3}$ ways. Therefore, $N_{1}=C_{8}^{2} \\cdot C_{2}^{1} \\cdot C_{6}^{3}=1120$;\n- $\\boldsymbol{k}=\\mathbf{2}$. Here, there are two L commands, two R commands, and two U and two D commands. For L and R, there are $C_{8}^{4} \\cdot C_{4}^{2}$ ways to place them.

{"Index": 3409, "problem": "A [i]T-tetromino[/i] is formed by adjoining three unit squares to form a $1 \\times 3$ rectangle, and adjoining on top of the middle square a fourth unit square.\nDetermine the least number of unit squares that must be removed from a $202 \\times 202$ grid so that it can be tiled using T-tetrominoes.", "answer": "4", "solution": "1. **Coloring the Grid:**\n   - Color the $202 \\times 202$ grid in a chessboard pattern, where each cell is either black or white, and adjacent cells have different colors.\n   - A T-tetromino covers 3 cells of one color and 1 cell of the other color. Therefore, to tile the entire grid, we need an equal number of T-tetrominoes that cover 3 black and 1 white cells and those that cover 3 white and 1 black cells.\n\n2. **Counting the Cells:**\n   - The total number of cells in the $202 \\times 202$ grid is $202 \\times 202 = 40804$.\n   - Since each T-tetromino covers 4 cells, the number of T-tetrominoes needed to cover the grid is $\\frac{40804}{4} = 10201$.\n   - However, 10201 is an odd number, which means we cannot have an equal number of T-tetrominoes of each type (3 black, 1 white and 3 white, 1 black). Therefore, it is impossible to tile the entire $202 \\times 202$ grid with T-tetrominoes without removing some cells.\n\n3. **Removing Cells:**\n   - To make the grid tileable by T-tetrominoes, we need to remove cells such that the remaining number of cells is divisible by 4.\n   - Since $40804$ is already divisible by 4, we need to remove at least 4 cells to make the grid tileable.\n\n4. **Choosing Cells to Remove:**\n   - Number the columns and rows from $0$ to $201$.\n   - Remove the cells at positions $(200,0)$, $(0,200)$, $(201,200)$, and $(201,201)$.\n   - After removing these 4 cells, the grid is divided into a $200 \\times 200$ grid and two strips of width 2 along the top and right edges, with some cells removed.\n\n5. **Tiling the $200 \\times 200$ Grid:**\n   - A $200 \\times 200$ grid can be tiled completely by T-tetrominoes because $200 \\times 200 = 40000$, which is divisible by 4.\n\n6. **Tiling the Strips:**\n   - Define $L_k$ as a structure obtained by deleting the upper rightmost cell and bottom leftmost cell from a $4k+1 \\times 2$ board.\n   - The rightmost part of the grid can be covered by $L_{50}$, and the uppermost part can also be covered by $L_{50}$.\n   - It is easy to see that $L_k$ structures can be covered by T-tetrominoes.\n\nConclusion:\nBy removing 4 specific cells, the $202 \\times 202$ grid can be tiled using T-tetrominoes.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$."}

Since there are 12 black squares, we can place at most 12 S-Tetrominos.\n\n4. **Placing the S-Tetrominos:**\n   Each S-Tetromino covers 4 squares. If we place 12 S-Tetrominos, they will cover $12 \\times 4 = 48$ squares. However, since each square can be covered by at most two tiles, we need to ensure that no square is counted more than twice.\n\n5. **Ensuring No Overlap:**\n   To maximize the number of squares covered, we need to ensure that the overlap is minimized. If we place the S-Tetrominos such that each square is covered exactly once, we can cover 24 squares without any overlap.\n\n6. **Example Configuration:**\n   Consider the following configuration where each S-Tetromino is placed without overlapping:\n   ```\n   S-Tetromino 1: (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2)\n   S-Tetromino 2: (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (1,4)\n   S-Tetromino 3: (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2)\n   S-Tetromino 4: (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4)\n   S-Tetromino 5: (4,0), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2)\n   S-Tetromino 6: (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)\n   ```\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   By placing the S-Tetrominos in such a way, we can cover 24 squares without any overlap. Therefore, the maximum number of squares that can be covered by at least one tile is 24.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{24}$"}

This means it moves by \\(\\pm1\\) unit in each of the \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) coordinates.\n\n2. **Target distance**: We need to find the probability that after two seconds, the particle is a distance of \\(2\\sqrt{2}\\) from its original location. The distance formula in three dimensions is given by:\n   \\[\n   d = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}\n   \\]\n   Setting \\(d = 2\\sqrt{2}\\), we get:\n   \\[\n   2\\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}\n   \\]\n   Squaring both sides:\n   \\[\n   8 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Possible coordinates**: We need to find integer solutions \\((x, y, z)\\) such that \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 8\\).

Since in each row the number of yellow cells is not less than the number of red cells, the same is true for the entire table. Therefore, the number of yellow and red cells is the same in each column. Indeed, if in one of the columns the number of yellow cells is less than the number of red cells, then there will be fewer of them in the entire table, since in the other columns their number is not greater than the number of red cells. Moreover, the number of red cells in each column is not less than $\\frac{5}{3}$, that is, it is at least 2. Thus, the table contains at least 10 red cells and the same number of yellow cells. Therefore, there are no more than 5 blue cells in the table. On the other hand, in each column the total number of yellow and red cells is even, so there is at least one blue cell in each column. Thus, the table contains no fewer than 5 blue cells. An example of coloring with five blue cells is shown in the figure."}

If these $n$ numbers can be divided into 41 groups with equal sums and also into 49 groups with equal sums, find the minimum value of $n$.\n\n", "answer": "89", "solution": "11 Let the 41 groups be $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\cdots, A_{41}$, where the sum of the numbers in each group is 49, and we call such groups $A$-type groups; and the 49 groups be $B_{1}, B_{2}, \\cdots, B_{49}$, where the sum of the numbers in each group is 41, and we call such groups $B$-type groups.\n\nClearly, each term $x_{k}$ belongs to exactly one $A$-type group and one $B$-type group, i.e., there are no common terms between groups of the same type. If two groups $A_{i}$ and $B_{j}$ have two common terms $x_{r}$ and $x_{t}$, then these two numbers can be combined into one term $x_{r} + x_{t}$, which would reduce the value of $n$. Therefore, we can assume that each pair of $A_{i}$ and $B_{j}$ has at most one common term.\n\nNow, use points $u_{1}, u_{2}, \\cdots, u_{41}$ to represent $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\cdots, A_{41}$, and points $v_{1}, v_{2}, \\cdots, v_{49}$ to represent $B_{1}, B_{2}, \\cdots, B_{49}$. If the groups $A_{i}$ and $B_{j}$ have a common term, then connect a line between the corresponding points $u_{i}$ and $v_{j}$. Thus, we obtain a bipartite graph $G$ with exactly $n$ edges and 90 vertices. We will prove that $G$ is a connected graph.\n\nIf the largest connected component of graph $G$ is $G^{\\prime}$, and the number of vertices in $G^{\\prime}$ is less than 90, suppose in the component $G^{\\prime}$ there are $a$ $A$-type vertices $u_{k_{1}}, u_{k_{2}}, \\cdots, u_{k_{a}}$ and $b$ $B$-type vertices $v_{s_{1}}, v_{s_{2}}, \\cdots, v_{s_{b}}$, where $a + b < 90$, then in the corresponding $A$-type groups $A_{k_{1}}, A_{k_{2}}, \\cdots, A_{k_{a}}$ and $B$-type groups $B_{s_{1}}, B_{s_{2}}, \\cdots, B_{s_{b}}$, each number $x_{i}$ in an $A$-type group $A_{k_{i}}$ must appear in some $B$-type group $B_{s_{j}}$; and each number $x_{j}$ in a $B$-type group $B_{s_{i}}$ must appear in some $A$-type group $A_{r_{j}}$ (otherwise, there would be an edge connecting to a vertex outside the component, leading to a contradiction). Therefore, the sum of the numbers in the $a$ $A$-type groups $A_{k_{1}}, A_{k_{2}}, \\cdots, A_{k_{a}}$ should equal the sum of the numbers in the $b$ $B$-type groups $B_{s_{1}}, B_{s_{2}}, \\cdots, B_{s_{b}}$, i.e., $49a = 41b$. This implies $41 \\mid a$ and $49 \\mid b$, so $a + b \\geq 41 + 49 = 90$, which is a contradiction! Therefore, $G$ is a connected graph. Thus, the graph $G$ has at least $90 - 1 = 89$ edges, i.e., $n \\geq 89$;\n\nOn the other hand, we can actually construct a sequence $x_{1}, x_{2}, \\cdots, x_{89}$ with 89 terms that satisfies the conditions of the problem. For example, take $x_{1} = \\cdots = x_{41} = 41, x_{42} = \\cdots = x_{75} = 8, x_{76} = \\cdots = x_{79} = 7, x_{80} = \\cdots = x_{83} = 1, x_{84} = x_{85} = 6, x_{86} = x_{87} = 2, x_{88} = 5, x_{89} = 3$ (this sequence has 41 terms with a value of 41, 34 terms with a value of 8, and the remaining seven 8s can be split into seven pairs, four pairs of $\\{7, 1\\}$, two pairs of $\\{6, 2\\}$, and one pair of $\\{5, 3\\}$, resulting in 14 additional terms). Thus, each $A$-type group can consist of one 41 and one 8, or one 41 and a pair of terms that sum to 8. This results in 41 $A$-type groups, each with a sum of 49. To obtain 49 $B$-type groups with a sum of 41, we can make $x_{1}, x_{2}, \\cdots, x_{41}$ each a group, and the remaining numbers can be combined into eight $B$-type groups: four groups of $\\{8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1\\}$, two groups of $\\{8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 2\\}$, one group of $\\{8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 3\\}$, and one group of $\\{8, 8, 7, 7, 6, 5\\}$. Therefore, the minimum value of $n$ is 89."}

Find $\\left(p+q+r+s\\right)\\left(a+b+c\\right)$.", "answer": "660", "solution": "Solution 1\nWe graph the $10$ shots on a grid. Suppose that a made shot is represented by a step of $(0,1)$, and a missed shot is represented by $(1,0)$. Then the basketball player's shots can be represented by the number of paths from $(0,0)$ to $(6,4)$ that always stay below the line $y=\\frac{2x}{3}$. We can find the number of such paths using a Pascal's Triangle type method below, computing the number of paths to each point that only move right and up.\n\nTherefore, there are $23$ ways to shoot $4$ makes and $6$ misses under the given conditions. The probability of each possible sequence occurring is $(.4)^4(.6)^6$. Hence the desired probability is\n\\[\\frac{23\\cdot 2^4\\cdot 3^6}{5^{10}},\\]\nand the answer is $(23+2+3+5)(4+6+10)=\\boxed{660}$.\n\nSolution 2\nThe first restriction is that $a_{10} = .4$, meaning that the player gets exactly 4 out of 10 baskets.  The second restriction is $a_n\\le.4$.  This means that the player may never have a shooting average over 40%.  Thus, the first and second shots must fail, since $\\frac{1}{1}$ and $\\frac{1}{2}$ are both over $.4$, but the player may make the third basket, since $\\frac{1}{3} \\le .4$  In other words, the earliest the first basket may be made is attempt 3.  Using similar reasoning, the earliest the second basket may be made is attempt 5, the earliest the third basket may be made is attempt 8, and the earliest the fourth basket may be made is attempt 10.\nUsing X to represent a basket and O to represent a failure, this 'earliest' solution may be represented as:\nOOXOXOOXOX\nTo simplify counting, note that the first, second, and tenth shots are predetermined.  The first two shots must fail, and the last shot must succeed.  Thus, only slots 3-9 need to be counted, and can be abbreviated as follows:\nXOXOOXO\nThe problem may be separated into five cases, since the first shot may be made on attempt 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.  The easiest way to count the problem is to remember that each X may slide to the right, but NOT to the left.\nFirst shot made on attempt 3:\nXOXOOXO\nXOXOOOX\nXOOXOXO\nXOOXOOX\nXOOOXXO\nXOOOXOX\nXOOOOXX\nTotal - 7\nFirst shot made on attempt 4:\nNote that all that needs to be done is change each line in the prior case from starting with \"XO.....\" to \"OX.....\".\nTotal - 7\nFirst shot made on attempt 5:\nOOXXOXO\nOOXXOOX\nOOXOXXO\nOOXOXOX\nOOXOOXX\nTotal - 5\nFirst shot made on attempt 6:\nOOOXXXO\nOOOXXOX\nOOOXOXX\nTotal - 3\nFirst shot made on attempt 7:\nOOOOXXX\nTotal - 1\nThe total number of ways the player may satisfy the requirements is $7+7+5+3+1=23$.\nThe chance of hitting any individual combination (say, for example, OOOOOOXXXX) is $\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^6\\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right)^4$\nThus, the chance of hitting any of these 23 combinations is $23\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^6\\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right)^4 = \\frac{23\\cdot3^6\\cdot2^4}{5^{10}}$\nThus, the final answer is $(23+3+2+5)(6+4+10)=\\boxed{660}$\n\nSolution 3\nNote $a_{10}=.4$. Therefore the player made 4 shots out of 10. He must make the 10th shot, because if he doesn't, then $a_9=\\frac{4}{9}>.4$. Since $a_n\\leq .4$ for all $n$ less than 11, we know that $a_1=a_2=0$. Now we must look at the 3rd through 9th shot.\nNow let's take a look at those un-determined shots. Let's put them into groups: the 3rd, 4th, and 5th shots in group A, and the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th shots in group B. The total number of shots made in groups A and B must be 3, since the player makes the 10th shot. We cannot have all three shots made in group A, since $a_5\\leq .4$. Therefore we can have two shots made, one shot made, or no shots made in group A.\nCase 1: Group A contains no made shots.\nThe number of ways this can happen in group A is 1. Now we must arrange the shots in group B accordingly. There are four ways to arrange them total, and all of them work. There are $\\textbf{4}$ possibilities here.\nCase 2: Group A contains one made shot.\nThe number of ways this could happen in group A is 3.  Now we must arrange the shots in group B accordingly. There are six ways to arrange them total, but the arrangement \"hit hit miss miss\" fails, because that would mean $a_7=\\frac{3}{7}>.4$. All the rest work. Therefore there are $3\\cdot5=\\textbf{15}$ possibilities here.\nCase 3: Group A contains two made shots.\nThe number of ways this could happen in group A is 2 (hit hit miss doesn't work but the rest do). Now we must arrange the shots in group B accordingly. Note hit miss miss miss and miss hit miss miss fail. Therefore there are only 2 ways to do this, and there are $2\\cdot 2=\\textbf{4}$ total possibilities for this case.\n\nTaking all these cases into account, we find that there are $4+15+4=23$ ways to have $a_{10} = .4$ and $a_n\\leq .4$. Each of these has a probability of $.4^4\\cdot.6^6=\\frac{2^4\\cdot 3^6}{5^{10}}$. Therefore the probability that we have $a_{10} = .4$ and $a_n\\leq .4$ is $\\frac{23\\cdot2^4\\cdot3^6}{5^{10}}$. Now we are asked to find the product of the sum of the primes and the sum of the exponents, which is $(23+2+3+5)(4+6+10)=33\\cdot20=\\boxed{660}$."}

The chords intersect if the points on the circumference are in the order $A C B D$ in one of the traversal directions. Place the points at arbitrary positions on the circumference. We can do this because the placement does not affect the intersection, only the names we give to the points. Let one of the placed points be $A$.

If we now label one of the neighbors of $A$ as $B$, then the segments $A B$ and $C D$ do not intersect if we label the \"opposite\" one, otherwise there will be an intersection point.

Every minute thereafter, Denys writes the number $a+b$ between all pairs of consecutive numbers $a$, $b$ on the board. How many odd numbers will be on the board after $10$ such operations?\n\n[i]Proposed by Michael Kural[/i]", "answer": "683", "solution": "1. **Reduction to modulo 2**: \n   We start by reducing all numbers to $\\pmod{2}$. This is valid because the parity (odd or even nature) of the numbers will determine the number of odd numbers on the board.\n\n2. **Define variables**:\n   Let $a_n$ be the number of $00$, $b_n$ be the number of $01$, $c_n$ be the number of $10$, and $d_n$ be the number of $11$ in adjacent pairs after $n$ operations.\n\n3. **Lemma 1**: \n   \\[\n   a_n + b_n + c_n + d_n = 2^n\n   \\]\n   **Proof**: \n   The number of numbers on the board after $n$ operations satisfies the recurrence $A_n = 2A_{n-1} - 1$. This is because each number generates a new number between each pair, doubling the count and then subtracting 1 for the overlap. Solving this recurrence with $A_1 = 3$, we get $A_n = 2^n + 1$. Therefore, the number of adjacent pairs is $A_n - 1 = 2^n$.\n\n4. **Lemma 2**: \n   \\[\n   a_n = 0, \\quad b_{n+1} = b_n + d_n, \\quad c_{n+1} = c_n + d_n, \\quad d_{n+1} = b_n + c_n\n   \\]\n   **Proof**: \n   The operations map as follows:\n   \\[\n   00 \\mapsto 000, \\quad 01 \\mapsto 011, \\quad 10 \\mapsto 110, \\quad 11 \\mapsto 101\n   \\]\n   From these mappings, we see that $a_{n+1} = 2a_n$. Since $a_1 = 0$, we have $a_n = 0$ for all $n$. The other recurrences follow from the mappings without overcounts.\n\n5. **Lemma 3**: \n   Let the number of $1$s after $n$ operations be $X_n$. Then,\n   \\[\n   X_n = X_{n-1} + b_{n-1} + c_{n-1}\n   \\]\n   **Proof**: \n   The mappings $01 \\mapsto 011$ and $10 \\mapsto 110$ each add one more $1$. Thus, the number of $1$s increases by the number of $01$ and $10$ pairs.\n\n6. **Lemma 4**: \n   Let $k_n = b_n + c_n$. Then,\n   \\[\n   k_n = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot 2^n + \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (-1)^n\n   \\]\n   **Proof**: \n   We have the recurrence:\n   \\[\n   k_n = b_n + c_n = b_{n-1} + c_{n-1} + 2d_{n-1} = k_{n-1} + 2k_{n-2}\n   \\]\n   The characteristic equation for this recurrence is:\n   \\[\n   x^2 - x - 2 = 0\n   \\]\n   Solving this, we get the roots $x = 2$ and $x = -1$. Using initial conditions $k_1 = 1$ and $k_2 = 3$, we find:\n   \\[\n   k_n = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot 2^n + \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (-1)^n\n   \\]\n\n7. **Calculate $X_{10}$**:\n   We have $X_1 = 2$ and:\n   \\[\n   X_n = X_{n-1} + \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot 2^{n-1} + \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (-1)^{n-1}\n   \\]\n   Solving for $X_{10}$:\n   \\[\n   X_{10} = 2 + \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot (2 + 2^2 + \\cdots + 2^9) + \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (-1 + 1 - \\cdots - 1)\n   \\]\n   The sum of the geometric series is:\n   \\[\n   2 + 2^2 + \\cdots + 2^9 = 2(1 + 2 + 2^2 + \\cdots + 2^8) = 2(2^9 - 1) = 2 \\cdot 511 = 1022\n   \\]\n   Thus:\n   \\[\n   X_{10} = 2 + \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot 1022 - \\frac{1}{3} = 2 + \\frac{2044}{3} - \\frac{1}{3} = 2 + \\frac{2043}{3} = 2 + 681 = 683\n   \\]\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{683}$."}

Purchasing no less than 6 disks at this price does not correspond, so in this case, at least one package was purchased. But nothing else, besides this package, could have been purchased, as it would have resulted in this package optimizing the purchase of fewer than 6 disks. But then we would have used such a method to purchase such a (less than 6) quantity.\n\nWhen purchasing 7 disks, the same package should have been used. The same sequentially (using the previously obtained information) we establish for 8, 9, and 10 disks.\n\nThe price of 11 disks is higher than 10. Therefore, this package contains only 10 disks. Thus, we have learned the parameters of one of the packages: it contains 10 disks and costs 111 rubles.\n\nNow notice that the price of purchasing 24 and 25 disks is the same, while for purchasing 26, it is different.\n\nWhen purchasing 25 disks, we could not use individual disks (since otherwise, by refusing one individual disk, we could have bought 24 disks 20 rubles cheaper than 25 disks, while the table shows the same price for these quantities). And it is impossible to get 25 disks with packages of 10 disks. Therefore, we have established another type of package: it contains 25 disks and costs 265 rubles. This package cannot contain more than 25 disks, as then 26 disks would cost the same.\n\nThus, we have established 2 types of packages: 1) 111 rubles for 10 disks (11.1 rubles per disk); 2) 265 rubles for 25 disks (10.6 rubles per disk).\n\nSince the condition states that there should be only two types of packages, we have determined all possible options.\n\nLet's determine the optimal price for purchasing 29 disks. We can buy three packages of 10 disks, which will cost 333 rubles.\n\nPurchasing individual disks is irrational: as soon as we buy one individual disk (for 20 rubles), we will need to buy 28 disks, the optimal price of which, according to the condition, is 325 rubles. In total, it will be 345 rubles.\n\nIf we buy a package of 25 disks, we will need to buy 4 more disks. From the table, it can be seen that it is cheapest to buy them individually. But, as we just found out, the price will be no less than 345 rubles.\n\nTherefore, the initially considered option (3 packages of 10 disks) is the most\n\nrational.\n\n## Answer\n\nFor sale are: individual disks at a price of 20 rubles; packages of 10 disks at a price of 111 rubles per package; packages of 25 disks at a price of 265 rubles per package.

At the same time, the total sum of the seat numbers did not change, so Anya's seat number must have decreased by 2.

How many cells can the chip end up in?", "answer": "121", "solution": "Answer: 121.\n\nSolution. We will paint the entire board in a checkerboard pattern so that the central cell of the board is black. With each move of the chip to an adjacent cell, the color of the cell on which the chip is standing will change. After an odd number of moves, the chip will always be on a white cell, and after an even number of moves - on a black cell. Therefore, after 10 moves, the chip will definitely be on a black cell.\n\nWe will show that to all black cells that can be reached in no more than 10 moves, it is possible to reach them exactly in 10 moves. Consider an arbitrary black cell $A$ that can be reached in fewer than 10 moves from the center. Since by the time the chip reaches cell $A$, an even number of moves, less than 10, has been made, one can simply move the chip to an adjacent cell and back until exactly 10 moves have been made. Therefore, we need to count the number of black cells that can be reached in no more than 10 moves.\n\nIn 0 moves, you can only reach the starting cell, in 2 moves you can reach the starting cell and $4 \\cdot 2=8$ new cells, in 4 moves you can reach the cells that have already been reached and $4 \\cdot 4=16$ new cells, and so on. We get that the number of cells that can be reached in no more than 10 steps is $1+8+16+24+\\ldots+40=$ $1+8(1+2+3+4+5)=121$\n\nRemark. The centers of the cells that can be reached in $k \\leqslant 10$ steps form the vertices of a square grid rotated by $45^{\\circ}$ (Fig. 6).

Similarly, we find that all except the 4 heaviest weigh no more than 50 g. Consider the kittens that are not among the 2 lightest and the 4 heaviest. Their total weight is 500-200-80=220g. There must be 5 of them, because if there were 4, the weight could not be more than $4 \\times 50=200$ g, and if there were 6, their weight would be no less than $6 \\times 40=240$ g. Therefore, there are 11 kittens in total."}

Two triangles are congruent if they can be made to coincide by rotation or reflection.\n\n2. **Counting Non-Congruent Triangles**: To count the non-congruent triangles, we need to consider the arc lengths subtended by the sides of the triangles. Since the points are equally spaced, the arc lengths can be represented by the number of points between the vertices of the triangle.\n\n3. **Partitioning the Circle**: We can think of the problem as partitioning the circle into three arcs. The sum of the arc lengths must be 15 (the total number of points). Let the lengths of the arcs be \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) such that \\(a + b + c = 15\\). Each arc length must be at least 1 (since each side of the triangle must connect distinct points).\n\n4. **Counting Partitions**: We need to count the number of ways to partition 15 into three parts, where each part is at least 1. This is equivalent to finding the number of solutions to the equation \\(a + b + c = 15\\) with \\(a, b, c \\geq 1\\).\n\n5. **Transforming the Problem**: We can transform the problem by letting \\(a' = a - 1\\), \\(b' = b - 1\\), and \\(c' = c - 1\\).

Skipping by $k$ points means that the destination point and the source point have $k-1$ points in between them. For example, skipping 1 point means going to an adjacent vertex.\n\n3. If $k$ divides $n$, then you won't go through all the $n$ points. For instance, if $n = 8$ and $k = 2$, you will only visit every second point, forming a smaller cycle within the $n$ points. Therefore, $k$ must not divide $n$ for the path to cover all $n$ points.\n\n4. The number of valid skips is given by Euler's totient function $\\phi(n)$, which counts the integers up to $n$ that are coprime with $n$. However, skipping by $k$ is the same as skipping by $n-k$ because skipping by $n-k$ just reverses the direction relative to skipping by $k$. Thus, we divide by 2 to account for this symmetry.\n\n5. Additionally, skipping by 1 never gives a valid star for any $n$ because it simply forms a regular polygon without intersecting lines. Therefore, we subtract one from our count.\n\n6.

The parabolas open outward along the radii of the circle and are tangent to each other in a cyclic manner.\n\n2. **Equation of the Parabolas:**\n   The given parabola is \\( y = \\frac{x^2}{16} \\). For a general parabola \\( y = \\frac{x^2}{4p} \\), we have \\( 4p = 16 \\), so \\( p = 4 \\).

Let the radius of the circle be \\( R \\). The vertices form a regular hexagon, so the distance between consecutive vertices (which is also the side length of the hexagon) is \\( R \\).\n\n4. **Tangency Condition:**\n   For two parabolas to be tangent to each other, the distance between their vertices must be such that their tangents at the points of tangency are equal. The tangents of the parabolas must meet at the center of the hexagon.\n\n5. **Slope of the Tangent:**\n   The slope of the tangent to the parabola \\( y = \\frac{x^2}{16} \\) at any point \\( (x, y) \\) is given by the derivative:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{x}{8}\n   \\]\n   We need the slope to be \\( \\sqrt{3} \\) (since the tangents form \\( 30^\\circ \\) angles with the radii of the circle):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{8} = \\sqrt{3} \\implies x = 8\\sqrt{3}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Coordinates of the Tangent Point:**\n   Substituting \\( x = 8\\sqrt{3} \\) into the parabola equation:\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{(8\\sqrt{3})^2}{16} = \\frac{192}{16} = 12\n   \\]\n   So, the point of tangency is \\( (8\\sqrt{3}, 12) \\).\n\n7. **Center of the Circle:**\n   The center of the circle must be directly below this point of tangency by the distance equal to the y-coordinate of the point of tangency (since the parabola is symmetric about the x-axis).

This does not change the sum of their positions, and hence the average position remains \\(1011\\).\n\n2. **Sum of Distances \\(S\\):**\n   - Let \\(S\\) be the sum of distances between every pair of people. We will show that \\(S\\) decreases with each move.\n   - Consider two people \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) standing at positions \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) respectively, with \\(a + 2 \\leq b\\). They move to \\(a+1\\) and \\(b-1\\) respectively.\n\n3. **Effect on \\(S\\):**\n   - We categorize the effect on \\(S\\) based on the positions of other people relative to \\(A\\) and \\(B\\):\n     - **People standing on \\(a\\) or less:** Their distance to \\(A\\) increases by 1, but their distance to \\(B\\) decreases by 1. Thus, their contribution to \\(S\\) is unchanged.\n     - **People standing on \\(b\\) or greater:** Their distance to \\(A\\) decreases by 1, but their distance to \\(B\\) increases by 1. Thus, their contribution to \\(S\\) is unchanged.\n     - **People standing in \\((a, b)\\):** Their distance to \\(A\\) decreases by 1, and their distance to \\(B\\) decreases by 1. Thus, their contribution to \\(S\\) decreases by 2 per person.\n   - Additionally, the distance between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) themselves decreases by 2.\n\n4. **Decrease in \\(S\\):**\n   - Even if no one is in the interval \\((a, b)\\), the distance between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) decreases by 2. Therefore, \\(S\\) decreases by at least 2 per move.\n   - Since \\(S\\) is a non-negative integer and decreases by at least 2 per move, the process must terminate after a finite number of moves.\n\n5. **Final Configuration:**\n   - The final configuration must have all people standing at the same position, as any other configuration would allow further moves.\n   - Given the invariant that the average position is \\(1011\\), the only possible final configuration is that all people stand at position \\(1011\\).\n\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\nThe final answer is all people standing at position \\( \\boxed{ 1011 } \\)."}

We know that each adult had to pay 3 reais to enter, each young person 2 reais, and each child 30 cents. What is the minimum number of adults who entered the park on that day?\n\n#", "answer": "2", "solution": "Solution\n\nTo find the minimum number of adults, we will divide the problem into cases:\n\na) Suppose it is possible to have 0 adults. Thus, the sum of the quantities of young people and children is 100. Consequently, if each child pays 1.70 more to match the contribution of the young people, we will have $2 \\cdot 100=200$ reais. Since the actual contribution of these people was 100, the difference $200-100=100$ corresponds to the extra contribution of the children. Therefore, the number of children is $\\frac{100}{1.7}$, which is not an integer. This shows that it is not possible to have 0 adults.\n\nb) Suppose it is possible to have 1 adult. Thus, the sum of the quantities of young people and children is 99. Again, if each child pays 1.70 more to match the contribution of the young people, we will have $2 \\cdot 99=198$ reais. Since the actual contribution of these people was $100-3 \\cdot 1=97$, the difference $198-97=101$ corresponds to the extra contribution of the children. Therefore, the number of children is $\\frac{101}{1.7}$, which is not an integer. This shows that it is not possible to have only 1 adult.\n\nc) To show that the minimum number of adults required is 2, it suffices to exhibit compatible quantities of young people and children with the data from the problem. Repeating the strategy from the previous cases of simulating the extra payment of 1.70 by each child, we can conclude that the number of children needed with 2 adults is\n\n$$\n\\frac{2 \\cdot (100-2)-(100-2 \\cdot 3)}{1.7}=60\n$$\n\nThus, with 2 adults, the quantities of young people and children are $100-2-60=38$ and 60, respectively. Note that $3 \\cdot 2+2 \\cdot 38+0.3 \\cdot 60=100$.\n\nTherefore, at least 2 adults are necessary.\n\nObservation: Assuming that $x, y$, and $z$ represent the quantities of adults, young people, and children, respectively, we can obtain another solution by writing:\n\n$$\nx+y+z=100 \\text{ and } 3x+2y+0.3z=100\n$$\n\nThen, it suffices to multiply the first equation by 20 and subtract it from the second equation multiplied by 10, obtaining $10x-17z=-1000$. From this, 17 divides $10(x+100)$. Since 100 leaves a remainder of 15 when divided by 17 and $\\text{gcd}(10,17)=1$, $x$ must leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 17. The smallest non-negative integer that leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 17 is 2. It then suffices to follow the final steps of the previous solution to exhibit an example with 2 adults."}

If the sports team\n\nhas 51 members, from smallest to largest, denoted as\n$$\na_{1}, a_{2}, \\cdots, a_{50}, a_{51} \\text {. }\n$$\n\nTake the differences\n$$\na_{51}-a_{1}, a_{51}-a_{2}, \\cdots, a_{51}-a_{50},\n$$\n\nthis results in $51+50=101$ numbers. Since the numbers in (1) and (2) do not exceed the range of 1 to 100, by the pigeonhole principle, there must be two numbers that are equal. However, the numbers in (1) are all distinct, and the numbers in (2) are also all distinct, so it can only be that a number $a_{i}$ in (1) equals a number $a_{51}-a_{j}$ in (2). This gives\n$$\na_{i}=a_{51}-a_{j},\n$$\n\nthus $a_{i}+a_{j}=a_{51}$.\nThis means that the number $a_{51}$ is equal to the sum of two other numbers (when $i \\neq j$) or equal to twice a certain member's number (when $i=j$), which contradicts the condition. Therefore, the maximum number of members is 50."}

If the first number to appear is 2, what is the 2020th number to appear?", "answer": "1", "solution": "Solution to Exercise 4 Let's start by looking at the first values displayed by the computer:\n\n$\\triangleright$ The first number is 2.\n\n$\\triangleright$ The second number is $2^{2}-2 \\times 2+1=1$\n\n$\\triangleright$ The third number is $1^{2}-2 \\times 1+1=1-2+1=0$\n\n$\\triangleright$ The fourth number is $0^{2}-2 \\times 0+1=1$\n\n$\\triangleright$ The fifth number is $1^{2}-2 \\times 1+1=1-2+1=0$\n\n$\\triangleright$ The sixth number is $0^{2}-2 \\times 0+1=1$\n\n$\\triangleright$ The seventh number is $1^{2}-2 \\times 1+1=1-2+1=0$\n\nWe see that the numbers that appear are in the order $2,1,0,1,0,1,0$. Since after a 0 there is necessarily $0^{2}-2 \\times 0+1=1$ and after a 1 there is necessarily $1^{2}-2 \\times 1+1=1-2+1=0$, we will have an alternation of 0 and 1. Since 1 appears in second place, all the numbers appearing at an even rank will be 1s, so the 2020th number is 1.\n\nComment from the graders We congratulate the students who have largely succeeded in this exercise. The few errors observed are mainly calculation errors or rank shifts in the numbers displayed. For example, some students considered that the rank of the first number to appear on the screen was rank 0, while it is rank 1. To avoid this mistake, some students used a table, which was greatly appreciated. We invite students to be vigilant about this kind of error, which has sometimes caused a lot of damage, and not to rush through the exercises, always checking the reasoning used."}

What is the maximum amount Vasya can earn if Petya aims to pay as little as possible?", "answer": "5", "solution": "Consider a 4026-digit number $A$, consisting of 2013 ones and 2013 twos. Let in this number, there are $k$ ones and $l=2013-k$ twos in the odd positions, then in the even positions there will be $k$ twos and $l$ ones (here $k$ can take any integer value from 0 to 2013). The difference between the sums of the digits in the odd positions and the even positions is $(k+2 l)-(2 k+l)=l-k=2013-2 k$. Since 2013 is divisible by 11, $A$ is divisible by 11 if and only if $k$ is divisible by 11.\n\nIn one move, $k$ can change by no more than 1. Therefore, if Vasya initially forms the number $A$ for which, say, $k=5$ (obviously, this is possible), then Petya will need at least 5 moves to get a number for which $k$ is divisible by 11.\n\nWe will show that five moves are always enough for Petya. By swapping a one in an odd position with a two in an even position, he can decrease $k$ by 1 in one move, provided that $k \\neq 0$. Similarly, by swapping a two in an odd position with a one in an even position, he can increase $k$ by 1 in one move, provided that $k \\neq 2013$. Let the initial number given by Vasya give a remainder $r$ when divided by 11. If $r=0$, then the initial number is already divisible by 11, and nothing needs to be done. If $1 \\leq r \\leq 5$, then in $r$ operations Petya can decrease $k$ by $r$ to the nearest number divisible by 11. If $6 \\leq r \\leq 10$, then in $11-r \\leq 5$ operations Petya can increase $k$ by $11-r$ to the nearest number divisible by 11 (this is possible because the largest possible value of $k=2013$ is divisible by 11).\n\n## Answer\n\n5 rubles."}

{"Index": 6559, "problem": "Rob is helping to build the set for a school play.  For one scene, he needs to build a multi-colored tetrahedron out of cloth and bamboo.

Three more lengths of bamboo are then cut to connect the other ends of the first three rods.  Rob then cuts out four triangular pieces of fabric: a blue piece, a red piece, a green piece, and a yellow piece.  These triangular pieces of fabric just fill in the triangular spaces between the bamboo, making up the four faces of the tetrahedron. The areas in square feet of the red, yellow, and green pieces are $60$, $20$, and $15$ respectively. If the blue piece is the largest of the four sides, find the number of square feet in its area.", "answer": "65", "solution": "1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   Rob is constructing a tetrahedron with three bamboo rods meeting at right angles.

The third cell cannot be empty, so the rabbit in the second cell has more neighbors than the rabbit in the first cell. Therefore, the rabbit in the first cell has three neighbors, and the rabbit in the second cell has seven neighbors.

Substitute \\( 1147 \\) into the equation:\n   \\[\n   37 + 31a = 1147 + a\n   \\]\n6. To isolate \\( a \\), subtract \\( a \\) from both sides:\n   \\[\n   37 + 31a - a = 1147\n   \\]\n   Simplify the left-hand side:\n   \\[\n   37 + 30a = 1147\n   \\]\n7. Subtract 37 from both sides to isolate the term with \\( a \\):\n   \\[\n   30a = 1147 - 37\n   \\]\n   Simplify the right-hand side:\n   \\[\n   30a = 1110\n   \\]\n8. Divide both sides by 30 to solve for \\( a \\):\n   \\[\n   a = \\frac{1110}{30} = 37\n   \\]\n\nThe final answer is \\( \\boxed{37} \\)"}

If k b-a - 1 = 9, then k b- a = 10, so k = 10, which we already know does not work. Hence k b-a - 1 < 9. But (k b + 1) - (k a + 1) = (k b-a - 1)k a . This must be divisible by 9, because k b + 1 and k a + 1 have the same digit sum and hence are the same mod 9. Hence k a must be divisible by 9, so k must be 3, 6 or 9.

Point $S$ is inside the square $U U^{\\prime} V^{\\prime} V$, so $\\Varangle U^{\\prime} S V^{\\prime}$ is inside the circle circumscribed to the square.

Notice that:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 2^{1917})^2 = 1 + 2^{1918} + 2^{2 \\cdot 1917} = 1 + 2^{1918} + 2^{3834}\n   \\]\n   This matches our expression for \\( B \\).\n\n7. Therefore, \\( B = (1 + 2^{1917})^2 \\), which is a perfect square. Hence, \\( x = 2008 \\) works.\n\n8. We need to verify that \\( x = 2008 \\) is the greatest value. If \\( x > 2008 \\), then \\( 2x - 182 > 3834 \\). In this case, \\( 2^{2x-182} \\) would dominate the expression, and \\( B \\) would not be a perfect square because:\n   \\[\n   (2^{x-91})^2 < 1 + 2^{1918} + 2^{2x-182} < (1 + 2^{x-91})^2\n   \\]\n   This inequality shows that \\( B \\) cannot be a perfect square for \\( x > 2008 \\).\n\nTherefore, the greatest value of \\( x \\) such that \\( A \\) is a perfect square is \\( x = 2008 \\).\n\nThe final answer is \\( \\boxed{2008} \\)."}

{"Index": 6957, "problem": "Find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that there are at least three distinct ordered pairs $(x,y)$ of positive integers such that \\[x^2-y^2=n.\\]", "answer": "45", "solution": "1. We start with the equation \\(x^2 - y^2 = n\\). This can be factored as:\n   \\[\n   x^2 - y^2 = (x+y)(x-y) = n\n   \\]\n   Therefore, \\(n\\) must be expressible as a product of two factors, say \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), where \\(a = x+y\\) and \\(b = x-y\\).\n\n2. For \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to be positive integers, both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must be positive integers, and they must have the same parity (both even or both odd). This is because \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are integers, and the sum and difference of two integers with the same parity are even, while the sum and difference of two integers with different parities are odd.\n\n3. We need at least three distinct ordered pairs \\((x, y)\\). This means we need at least three pairs \\((a, b)\\) such that \\(a \\cdot b = n\\) and both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have the same parity.\n\n4. To find the smallest \\(n\\), we need to consider the smallest \\(n\\) that has at least three pairs of factors \\((a, b)\\) with the same parity.

Verify that these pairs give distinct \\((x, y)\\) pairs:\n   - For \\((1, 45)\\):\n     \\[\n     x + y = 45, \\quad x - y = 1 \\implies 2x = 46 \\implies x = 23, \\quad 2y = 44 \\implies y = 22\n     \\]\n     So, \\((x, y) = (23, 22)\\).\n\n   - For \\((3, 15)\\):\n     \\[\n     x + y = 15, \\quad x - y = 3 \\implies 2x = 18 \\implies x = 9, \\quad 2y = 12 \\implies y = 6\n     \\]\n     So, \\((x, y) = (9, 6)\\).\n\n   - For \\((5, 9)\\):\n     \\[\n     x + y = 9, \\quad x - y = 5 \\implies 2x = 14 \\implies x = 7, \\quad 2y = 4 \\implies y = 2\n     \\]\n     So, \\((x, y) = (7, 2)\\).\n\n6.

Each successive term of this sequence is a vertex not contained previously in the sequence. Since there are a finite number of distinct vertices, this sequence must eventually return to $V_1$. Therefore, each vertex of $G$ is contained in a cycle.**\n\n6. **Let $V_1, V_2, V_3, \\dots, V_m$ be one such cycle with period $m$ containing a vertex $V_1$. Since each vertex has a red and blue edge incident to it, $m$ must be even. This follows from counting the total number of red edges: each vertex has exactly one red edge incident to it, and each red edge is counted twice from the two vertices connected to it, giving a total of $\\frac{m}{2}$ red edges. If $m$ were odd, the number of red edges would not be an integer.**\n\n7. **Consider a plane containing line $V_{m-1}V_m$ not containing any other vertices of $\\Pi$. Such a plane exists because there are finitely many vertices of $\\Pi$ and infinitely many angles at which we can form a plane containing $V_{m-1}V_m$. Call this plane the \"blue plane\".

Therefore, $V_1$ is on the left side, $V_2$ is on the right side, $V_3$ is on the left side, $V_4$ is on the right side, and in general $V_{2i-1}$ is on the left side and $V_{2i}$ is on the right side, except for $V_{m-1}$ and $V_m$ which lie on the blue plane.**\n\n9. **Since $V_{m-1}V_m$ is a blue edge, $V_{m-2}V_{m-1}$ is a red edge. Since $m$ is even, $V_{m-2}$ lies on the right side of the blue plane. $V_{m-2}$, $P$, and $V_{m-1}$ are collinear in that order. Thus, the line $V_{m-2}P$ intersects the blue plane at a point other than $V_{m-1}$, which is a contradiction because two lines can intersect only once. Therefore, a convex polyhedron cannot have two pivot points.**\n\n10. **Now, we prove that $n=1$ works. Consider a cube (which is a convex polyhedron) with the pivot point as the center of the cube.

We can assume that the first bulb is red. Since there must be a blue bulb next to each red bulb, three red bulbs cannot go in a row. Therefore, among any three consecutive bulbs, at least one bulb must be blue. Then, among the first 48 bulbs, there will be no fewer than $48: 3=16$ blue ones.

In base 2, the first number is $11111111$, which is the only way to choose 8 1's out of 8 spaces, or $\\binom{8}{8}$.  What about 9 spaces?  Well, all told, there are $\\binom{9}{8}=9$, which includes the first 1.  Similarly, for 10 spaces, there are $\\binom{10}{8}=45,$ which includes the first 9.  For 11 spaces, there are $\\binom{11}{8}=165$, which includes the first 45.  You're getting the handle.  For 12 spaces, there are $\\binom{12}{8}=495$, which includes the first 165; for 13 spaces, there are $\\binom{13}{8}=13 \\cdot 99 > 1000$, so we now know that $N$ has exactly 13 spaces, so the $2^{12}$ digit is 1.  \nNow we just proceed with the other 12 spaces with 7 1's, and we're looking for the $1000-495=505th$ number.

{"Index": 7317, "problem": "20. The number $N=3^{16}-1$ has a divisor of 193. It also has some divisors between 75 and 85 inclusive. What is the sum of these divisors?", "answer": "247", "solution": "20. 247 First factorise $N$ twice using the difference of two squares i.e. $N=3^{16}-1=\\left(3^{8}-1\\right)\\left(3^{8}+1\\right)=\\left(3^{4}-1\\right)\\left(3^{4}+1\\right)\\left(3^{8}+1\\right)=80 \\times 82 \\times\\left(3^{8}+1\\right)$. This shows that both 80 and 82 are divisors of $N$ in the required range. The question tells us that 193 is a divisor of $\\mathrm{N}$ and, since 193 is prime, it must be a divisor of $3^{8}+1=81 \\times 81+1=6562$. Now observe that $6562=2 \\times 3281$ and that $3281 \\div 193=17$. Therefore $N=80 \\times 82 \\times 2 \\times 17 \\times 193$ or $N=\\left(2^{4} \\times 5\\right) \\times(2 \\times 41) \\times 2 \\times 17 \\times 193$.\nNext consider the integers from 75 to 85 inclusive to see which could be divisors of $N$. Because $N$ has no prime factors of 3 or 7 , we know that $75,77,78,81$ and 84 are not divisors of $N$ while the initial argument established that 80 and 82 are divisors of $N$. Both 79 and 83 are prime and $76=4 \\times 19$ so, since $N$ does not have a prime factor of 79,83 or 19 , these must also be excluded. This only leaves 85 to be considered. Note that $85=5 \\times 17$ and both 5 and 17 are prime factors of $N$ so 85 is a divisor of $N$. Hence the divisors of $N$ in the required range are 80,82 and 85 with sum 247 ."}

For the third digit, we will have only 3 choices, as we cannot choose a digit that has already been used, and so on. We will have 2 choices for the fourth digit and only one choice for the last digit.

The same applies to 3, 4, and 5. We conclude then that the first 24 numbers start with 1, then we have 24 that start with 2, followed by 24 that start with 3.

The difference in damage thus corresponds to the number of bottles forming one third of the row multiplied by 60 CZK. One third of the row would thus consist of $660 : 60 = 11$ bottles, and the total number of bottles would be $3 \\cdot 11 = 33$. According to the problem statement, the cat knocked over 25 bottles, which is more than two thirds of the total 33 bottles. The condition stated at the beginning of this paragraph is not met, and therefore the cat could not have stopped in the second third of the row.\n\nIf the cat knocked over more than two thirds of the bottles, only a few of the cheapest ones remained. If it had knocked over from the opposite end, the same number of the most expensive bottles would have remained untouched. The difference in damage corresponds to the number of untouched bottles multiplied by 60 CZK. There must have been $660 : 60 = 11$ untouched bottles, and the total number of bottles $11 + 25 = 36$. This means that the cat knocked over all 12 of the most expensive bottles $(36 : 3 = 12)$, all 12 mid-priced ones, and one of the cheapest. This solution fits.\n\nThere were originally 36 bottles on the shelf."}

Additionally, the maximum total score of the first $k$ teams playing against the remaining $12-k$ teams is $3 \\cdot 2 k(12-\\dot{k})$. Therefore, the maximum total score of the first $k$ teams is $6 C_{k}^{2}+6 k(12-k)$.

If 10 participants win prizes, then the remaining 5 participants' scores cannot exceed 10 points. However, in fact, these 5 participants play 10 matches among themselves, generating a total of 20 points. Therefore, the scores of these 5 participants will not be less than 20 points, which is a contradiction. So, the situation where 10 participants win prizes does not exist.  \nConsidering 9 participants winning prizes, then the remaining 6 participants' scores cannot exceed 30 points. This is feasible. The top 9 participants draw with each other, each getting 8 points, and they all defeat the remaining 6 participants, each getting 12 points. Thus, these 9 participants each get 20 points, while the remaining 6 participants have already lost 9 matches, and their scores cannot exceed 10 points. In summary, the maximum number of participants who can win prizes is 9."}

We know:\n   \\[\n   S = \\frac{1}{(1-x)^2}\n   \\]\n   Substituting $x = \\frac{1}{3}$, we get:\n   \\[\n   S = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{4}{9}} = \\frac{9}{4}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Final Calculation:**\n   Substituting $S$ back into the expression for $E$, we get:\n   \\[\n   E = \\frac{4}{3} \\cdot \\frac{9}{4} = 3\n   \\]\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$."}

Then we must have $11k^2\\pm k + 1 = 11rs$, which leads to $k\\equiv \\mp 1 \\pmod{11}$, i.e., $k\\in \\{1,10,12,21,23,\\ldots\\}$. \n$k=1$ leads to $rs=1$ (impossible)! Then $k=10$ leads to $rs=103$, a prime (impossible). Finally, for $k=12$ we get $rs=143=11\\cdot 13$. \nThus our answer is $m=11k= \\boxed{132}$.\n\nSolution 1b\nLet $m^2 - m + 11 = pqrs$ for primes $p, q, r, s\\ge11$. If $p, q, r, s = 11$, then $m^2-m+11=11^4$. We can multiply this by $4$ and complete the square to find $(2m-1)^2=4\\cdot 11^4-43$. But \n\\[(2\\cdot 11^2-1)^2=4\\cdot 11^4-4\\cdot 11^2+1 <4\\cdot 11^4-43<(2\\cdot 11^2)^2,\\]\nhence we have pinned a perfect square $(2m-1)^2=4\\cdot 11^4-43$ strictly between two consecutive perfect squares, a contradiction. Hence $pqrs \\ge 11^3 \\cdot 13$. Thus $m^2-m+11\\ge 11^3\\cdot 13$, or $(m-132)(m+131)\\ge0$. From the inequality, we see that $m \\ge 132$. $132^2 - 132 + 11 = 11^3 \\cdot 13$, so $m = \\boxed{132}$ and we are done."}

Let $a_{1}$ be the smallest angle, and we use the formula for the sum of 6 terms of an arithmetic sequence $s_{6}=\\frac{n\\left(2 a_{1}+(n-1) d\\right)}{2}$, along with the information about the sum of the interior angles of a hexagon $6 \\cdot 180^{\\circ}-360^{\\circ}=720^{\\circ}$.

Given that $ABCDEF$ is a hexagon inscribed in a circle and $\\angle ACE = 90^\\circ$, we can infer that $AE$ is a diameter of the circle. This is because an inscribed angle that subtends a semicircle (or diameter) is a right angle.\n\n2. Since $AE$ is a diameter, the points $A$, $C$, and $E$ divide the circle into two semicircles. Therefore, $\\overarc{AC} + \\overarc{CE} = 180^\\circ$.\n\n3. We need to find the average of the measures of $\\angle ABC$ and $\\angle CDE$. To do this, we will use the properties of the inscribed angles and arcs.\n\n4. Note that $\\angle ABC$ and $\\angle CDE$ are inscribed angles that subtend arcs $\\overarc{AC}$ and $\\overarc{CE}$ respectively. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it subtends.\n\n5. Let $\\overarc{AC} = x$ and $\\overarc{CE} = y$. Since $AE$ is a diameter, we have:\n   \\[\n   x + y = 180^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n6.

The average of $\\angle ABC$ and $\\angle CDE$ is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\angle ABC + \\angle CDE}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{y}{2}}{2} = \\frac{x + y}{4}\n   \\]\n\n8.

However, the solution provided in the problem states that the average is $135^\\circ$. This discrepancy suggests a misunderstanding in the problem's interpretation.

This approach seems to consider the entire circle's arc subtended by $A$ to $E$ and $C$ to $A$ and $E$ to $C$. This is incorrect because it overestimates the angles.\n\n12. The correct approach is to use the inscribed angle theorem directly:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\angle ABC + \\angle CDE}{2} = \\frac{45^\\circ + 45^\\circ}{2} = 45^\\circ\n   \\]\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{45^\\circ}$."}

Determine the smallest integer $k$ for which Alice can color the integers $2,3, \\ldots, 31$ using $k$ colors.", "answer": "4", "solution": "In this problem, we are looking for the smallest integer $k$ satisfying a certain property. Suppose we want to show that the smallest integer sought is the integer $c$. There will then be two parts to the proof. On the one hand, it is necessary to show that if an integer $k$ satisfies the property, then $k \\geqslant c$, on the other hand, it is necessary to show that we can indeed find a coloring of the integers with $c$ colors.\n\n1) First, let's try to color the integers as we go in a naive way:\n\n- We color 2 with the first color\n- We also color 3 with the first color (it is possible because 2 does not divide 3).\n- 4 is divisible by 2, so we cannot color it with the same color as 2, we therefore color it with another color (the second color).\n- We can color 5 with the first color.\n- 6 being divisible by 2 and 3, we color it with the second color.\n- We can color 7 with the first color.\n- But 8 is divisible by 2 and 4, it must therefore be colored with a third color.\n\nWe have thus obtained a coloring with 3 colors of the integers from 2 to 8. It is now necessary to verify that 3 colors are necessarily required in a coloring satisfying the property of the statement. In the previous construction, the problem was to color 8. Indeed, 8 is a multiple of 4 and 2 and 4 is a multiple of 2. Thus 4 cannot have the same color as 2 and 8 cannot have the same color as 2 or 4. Therefore, at least 3 different colors are needed to color $2,4,8$, so the smallest number of colors necessary is $k=3$.\n\n2) Here, let's be inspired by the first question. We saw that $2,4,8$ were the numbers bringing a constraint in the coloring. We notice that these are powers of 2. We can therefore conjecture that the powers of 2 play an important role in the problem. Among the integers from 2 to 32, there are 5 powers of $2: 2,4,8$ and 16. As 2 divides $4,8,16,2$ must necessarily be of a different color from the other 3. As 4 divides $8,16,4$ must necessarily be of a different color from the other 2. Similarly, as 8 divides 16, $2,4,8,16$ must necessarily have different colors from each other. Therefore, at least 4 different colors are needed.\n\nConversely, we are looking for a coloring of the integers from 2 to 32 using exactly 4 colors. We can in fact continue the previous coloring by coloring each integer as we go with the smallest possible color. We get the following coloring:\n\n1. The numbers colored with color 1 are $2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31$\n2. The numbers colored with color 2 are $4,6,9,10,14,15,21,22,25,26$\n3. The numbers colored with color 3 are $8,12,18,20,27,28,30$\n4. The numbers colored with color 4 are 16,24\n\nWe do indeed have a correct coloring with 4 colors, so the minimum number of colors is 4.\n\nAlternative solution: As in the previous case, we show that for the first question, at least 3 colors are needed and at least 4 in the second.\n\nHere we propose to generalize the previous coloring: we construct a coloring with the optimal number of colors to color the integers from 2 to $r$, with $r \\geqslant 2$. Let $n \\geqslant 2$, and let $n=p_{1}^{a_{1}} \\times \\cdots \\times p_{k}^{a_{k}}$ be its prime factorization. We will color $n$ with the color $a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{k}$ (note that since $n \\geqslant 2$, we indeed have $a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{k} \\geqslant 1$). Let's show that this coloring is correct: let $m \\neq n$ be two integers such that $m$ divides $n$. Let $n=p_{1}^{a_{1}} \\times \\cdots \\times p_{k}^{a_{k}}$ be its prime factorization. $m$ necessarily writes as $m=p_{1}^{b_{1}} \\times \\cdots \\times p_{k}^{b_{k}}$ with $b_{1} \\leqslant a_{1}, \\ldots b_{k} \\leqslant a_{k}$. Since $m \\neq n$, there must necessarily be an $i$ such that $a_{i} \\neq b_{i}$, so $a_{i}>b_{i}$. Thus we must have $a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{k}>b_{1}+\\cdots+b_{k}$, so $m$ and $n$ are indeed of different colors.\n\nIf $n \\leqslant 8$ and $n=p_{1}^{a_{1}} \\times \\cdots \\times p_{k}^{a_{k}}$ then $2^{3}=8 \\geqslant n \\geqslant 2^{a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{k}}$ so $a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{k} \\leqslant 3$, the coloring uses at most 3 colors for the integers from 2 to 8, so for the first question, the minimal $k$ is 3.\n\nIf $n \\leqslant 31$ and $n=p_{1}^{a_{1}} \\times \\cdots \\times p_{k}^{a_{k}}$ then $2^{5}=32>n \\geqslant 2^{a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{k}}$ so $a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{k}n$. Let $j$ be an integer such that $2 \\leqslant j \\leqslant n$. Let $l$ be the largest integer such that $2^{l} \\leqslant j$ and similarly $2^{l+1}>j$. Since $2 \\leqslant j \\leqslant n<2^{k+1}$, we have $1 \\leqslant l<k+1$, so $1 \\leqslant l \\leqslant k$. We will color $j$ with the color $l$.\n\nNote that since $1 \\leqslant l \\leqslant k$, this coloring uses at most $k$ colors. Since $2 \\leqslant 2 \\leqslant 4 \\leqslant \\cdots \\leqslant 2^{k} \\leqslant n$, the $2^{j}$ for $1 \\leqslant j \\leqslant k$ are between 2 and $n$, and since $2^{j}$ is colored with the color $j$, the coloring uses exactly $j$ colors.\n\nThis coloring also satisfies the property of the statement: let $m, n$ such that $m$ divides $n$ and $m \\neq n$. Let $j$ be the color of $m$, we have $m \\geqslant 2^{j}$. Since $m$ divides $n$ and $m \\neq n, n \\geqslant 2 m \\geqslant 2^{j+1}$, so $n$ cannot be colored with the color $j$, otherwise we would have $n<2^{j+1}$.\n\nIn particular for $n=8$, since $2^{3}=8<2^{4}$, the proposed coloring uses 3 colors and for $n=31$, since $2^{4} \\leqslant n<2^{5}$, the coloring uses 4 colors. Thus for the first question, the minimal $k$ is 3, for the second it is 4.\n\nComment: In this exercise, each question contained two parts. For example, for question 2), it was necessary to show on the one hand that we can color the integers with 4 colors, on the other hand, it is necessary to show that, whatever the coloring, it always uses at least 4 colors. It is only by treating each point separately that one could get the maximum score. Moreover, a large part of the students made good progress on the problem and provided a valid coloring with the right number of colors."}

In this case, $x$, $x+p$, and $x-p$ are all perfect squares, but\n$$\nx+p \\equiv 3 \\text { or } 7(\\bmod 8),\n$$\n\nwhich is a contradiction.\nTherefore, $x$ is odd, and in this case, $(x-p, x+p)=2$.\nLet $x=r^{2}, x-p=2 s^{2}, x+p=2 t^{2}$.\nSince $(x+p)-(x-p)=2 p \\equiv 2(\\bmod 4)$,\n\nwe have $s^{2}-t^{2} \\equiv 1(\\bmod 2)$.\nThus, one of $s^{2}$ and $t^{2}$ is even.\nConsequently, one of $s$ and $t$ is even.\nThen $r^{2}=x=2 s^{2}+p=2 t^{2}-p \\equiv 3$ or $5(\\bmod 8)$, which is impossible.\nTherefore, when $p \\nmid y$, the original equation has no solutions.\n(2) $p \\mid y$.\nIf $y=0$, it is easy to see that the original equation has three solutions:\n$(0,0),(p, 0),(-p, 0)$.\nAssume $y \\neq 0$. Since $p \\mid y$, we have\n$(x-p, x, x+p)=p \\Rightarrow p^{2} \\mid y$.\nLet $x=p a, y=p^{2} b$.

{"Index": 8705, "problem": "72*. Two hunters $A$ and $B$ went duck hunting. Suppose each of them hits a duck they encounter as often as they miss. Hunter $A$ encountered 50 ducks during the hunt, and hunter $B$ encountered 51 ducks. What is the probability that hunter $B$'s catch will exceed hunter $A$'s catch?", "answer": "\\frac{1}{2}", "solution": "72. Since each of the hunters $A$ and $B$ hits and kills a duck as often as they miss, the probability of killing a duck for each of these hunters with each individual shot is $1 / 2$, i.e., the same as the probability of a coin landing heads. Thus, our problem is equivalent to the following: $A$ tosses a coin 50 times, and $B$ tosses it 51 times; what is the probability that heads will appear more times for $B$ than for $A$? It is not difficult to calculate the number of equally probable outcomes of this experiment; however, calculating the number of favorable outcomes here is relatively complex. We will not perform this calculation, but instead use the following simple artificial reasoning.\n\nThe set of all outcomes of the experiment, where $A$ tosses a coin 50 times and $B$ tosses it 51 times, can be divided into the following two parts: 1) the set of all outcomes where $B$ gets more heads than $A$, and 2) the set of all outcomes where $B$ gets no more (i.e., fewer or the same number of) heads than $A$. Note now that if $B$ gets the same number of heads as $A$ or even fewer, then it means that the tails for $B$ appeared more times than for $A$, and vice versa, if the tails for $B$ appeared more times than for $A$, then it means that the heads for $B$ appeared either the same number of times as for $A$ or even fewer (since $B$ tosses the coin one more time than $A$). Therefore, the set of outcomes where $B$ gets no more heads than $A$ coincides with the set of outcomes where $B$ gets more tails than $A$. But in the case of complete equality of heads and tails on the coin, the number of outcomes where $B$ gets more heads than $A$ should be equal to the number of outcomes where $B$ gets more tails than $A$. Thus, in our problem, the number of favorable outcomes of the experiment is equal to the number of unfavorable outcomes, from which it immediately follows that the desired probability is $1 / 2$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that $B$'s catch will exceed $A$'s catch is $1 / 2$.\n\nNote. The provided solution remains valid in the case where $A$ encounters $n$ ducks during the hunt, and $B$ encounters $n+1$ ducks. And in this more general case, the probability that $B$'s catch will exceed $A$'s catch is also $1 / 2$."}

Thus, if $AD$ were increased, $\\overline{CD}$ would have to be moved even farther outwards from $A$ to maintain the angle of $\\frac{\\pi}{3}$ and $\\omega$ could not touch it, a contradiction.\nProof 2. Again, use the triangle inequality to obtain $AD \\geq 20\\sqrt{7}$. Let $x = AD$ and $y = CD$. By the law of cosines on $\\triangle ADC$, $2100 = x^2+y^2-xy \\iff y^2-xy+(x^2-2100) = 0$. Viewing this as a quadratic in $y$, the discriminant $\\Delta$ must satisfy $\\Delta = x^2-4(x^2-2100) = 8400-3x^2 \\geq 0 \\iff x \\leq 20\\sqrt{7}$. Combining these two inequalities yields the desired conclusion.\nThis observation tells us that $E$, $A$, and $D$ are collinear, in that order.\nThen, $\\triangle ADC$ and $\\triangle ACF$ are $30-60-90$ triangles. Hence $AF = 15\\sqrt {7}$, and\n\n$EF = EA + AF = 10\\sqrt {7} + 15\\sqrt {7} = 25\\sqrt {7}$.\nFinally, the answer is $25+7=\\boxed{032}$."}

Additionally, let $h$ be the length of the altitude from vertex $C$ in triangle $A B C$.\n\nFrom $A B \\| R S$, we conclude that triangles $A B C$ and $S R C$ are similar.\n\nFurthermore, since $A B \\| R S$ and $|Q R|=y$, the lines on which the altitudes from $C$ in triangles $A B C$ and $S R C$ lie coincide, so the length of the altitude from $C$ in triangle $S R C$ is $h-y$.\n\nFrom the similarity of triangles $A B C$ and $S R C$, the ratio of corresponding side lengths is equal to the ratio of the altitudes from $C$. Therefore, we have\n\n$$\n\\frac{|R S|}{|A B|}=\\frac{h-y}{h}\n$$\n\nUsing the notations from the beginning of the solution, the above equality becomes\n\n$$\nx=\\frac{c}{h}(h-y)\n$$\n\nLet $P$ be the area of rectangle $P Q R S$. Then\n\n$$\nP=x y=\\frac{c}{h} \\cdot y(h-y)\n$$\n\nThe above expression is a quadratic function in the variable $y$. It achieves its maximum at the vertex, for the value $y=\\frac{h}{2}$.\n\nIn this case, we have\n\n$$\nP=\\frac{c}{h} \\cdot \\frac{h^{2}}{4}=\\frac{c h}{4}=\\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n\nsince the area of triangle $A B C$ is 1.\n\nTherefore, the upper bound on the area of rectangle $P Q R S$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThis bound can be achieved when $y=\\frac{h}{2}$, which corresponds to the case where the line $R S$ bisects the altitude from $C$, and thus also the sides $\\overline{A C}$ and $\\overline{B C}$. This is the case when points $R$ and $S$ are the midpoints of sides $\\overline{B C}$ and $\\overline{A C}$, respectively, and $P$ and $Q$ are their orthogonal projections onto the line $A B$.\n\nThus, the maximum possible area of rectangle $P Q R S$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nNote: The scoring scheme is structured as follows:\n\n- The answer that the desired maximum is $\\frac{1}{2}$, which earns the last 1 point in the scoring scheme;\n- The proof that the area of the rectangle cannot be greater than $\\frac{1}{2}$, which earns the first 8 points in the scoring scheme;\n- The description of an example of choosing points $P, Q, R$, and $S$ for which the area of rectangle $P Q R S$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$, which earns the second-to-last 1 point in the scoring scheme.\n\nAfter the area of rectangle $P Q R S$ is expressed in terms of one variable, the proof that its area is less than $\\frac{1}{2}$ can also be done using the A-G inequality."}

Within the range of 1 to 30, there are many identical smaller integers.

Let this polygon be $M$ and the angle $\\alpha$ subtended by $M$ at the origin be bounded by two lines $l_{1}$ and $l_{2}$. Then, any polygon in the group must intersect at least one of these two lines. Indeed, let $M^{\\prime}$ be any polygon different from $M$. By the given condition, there must be a line $l$ passing through the origin that intersects both $M$ and $M^{\\prime}$. Thus, the line $l$ is either between $l_{1}$ and $l_{2}$ (i.e., intersects the interior of $\\angle \\alpha$) or coincides with one of $l_{1}$ or $l_{2}$. If the latter is the case, the problem is already solved. If $l$ is indeed between $l_{1}$ and $l_{2}$, then since the angle $\\beta$ subtended by $M^{\\prime}$ at the origin is not less than $\\alpha$, there must be a line $l^{\\prime}$ passing through the origin that intersects $M^{\\prime}$ but does not intersect the interior of $\\angle \\alpha$. If $l^{\\prime}$ coincides with one of $l_{1}$ or $l_{2}$, the problem is solved. If $l^{\\prime}$ is outside $\\angle \\alpha$, this precisely means that one of $l_{1}$ or $l_{2}$, say $l_{1}$, lies within the angle $\\beta$ between $l$ and $l^{\\prime}$. Thus, both polygons $M$ and $M^{\\prime}$ intersect the line $l_{1}$. Therefore, the smallest natural number $m=2$."}

(1985, National Junior High School League)", "answer": "(1) m=5, n=7, r=663; (2) m=5, n=5, r=1981; (3) m=3, n=3, r=1981; (4) m=1, n=3, r=1987; (5) m=1, n=7, r=399", "solution": "According to the problem, the number of unit cubes without red faces is $(m-2)(n-2)(r-2)$, the number of unit cubes with one red face is $2[(m-2)(n-2)+(m-2)(r-2)+(n-2)(r-2)]$, and the number of unit cubes with two red faces is $4[(m-2)+(n-2)+(r-2)]$. Setting up the equation, we get\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\quad(m-2)(n-2)(r-2)+4[(m-2)+(n-2) \\\\\n+(r-2)]-2[(m-2)(n-2)+(m-2)(r-2) \\\\\n+(n-2)(r-2)]=1985 .\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nSimplifying and organizing, we get $(m-4)(n-4)(r-4)=1977$.\nSince $1977=3 \\times 659$,\nwe have $(m-4)(n-4)(r-4)=1 \\times 3 \\times 659$.\nGiven $m-4 \\leqslant n-4 \\leqslant r-4$, we get\n$$\nm-4=1, n-4=3, r-4=659 .\n$$\n\nThus, $m=5, n=7, r=663$.\nAlso, from $(m-4)(n-4)(r-4)=1 \\times 1 \\times 1977$,\nwe get another solution $m=5, n=3, r=1981$.\nFurthermore, from $(m-4)(n-4)(r-4)=(-1) \\times(-1) \\times 1977$, we get $m=3, n=3, r=1981$.\nWhen $m=2$, the original equation becomes\n$$\n0+4[(n-2)+(r-2)]-2(n-2)(r-2)=1985 \\text {. }\n$$\n\nThe left side is even, while the right side is odd, so the equation has no solution.\nWhen $m=1$, the original equation becomes $0+(n-2)(r-2)-0=1985$.\nIt is easy to see that when $n, r \\geq 3$, from $1985=1 \\times 1985$ or $1985=5 \\times 397$, we get two more solutions: $n-2=1, r-2=1985$, hence $n=3, r=1987$ or $n-2=5, r-2=397$. Thus, $n=7, r=399$.\nIn summary, the solutions for $m, n, r$ are 5 groups:\n(1) $\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}m=5, \\\\ n=7, \\\\ r=663 ;\\end{array}\\right.$ (2) $\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}m=5 ; \\\\ n=5, \\\\ r=1981 ;\\end{array} \\quad\\right.$ (3) $\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}m=3, \\\\ n=3, \\\\ r=1981 ;\\end{array}\\right.$\n(4) $\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}m=1, \\\\ n=3, \\\\ r=1987 ;\\end{array} \\quad\\right.$ (5) $\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}m=1 \\\\ n=7 \\\\ r=399 .\\end{array}\\right.$"}

Note that if a pair $(a, b)$ satisfies this equation, it automatically follows that $\\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)=1$. Suppose that $t \\mid a$ and $t \\mid b$, then $t \\mid a b$ and $t \\mid a-b$, so $t \\mid 1$, so $a$ and $b$ have no common divisor greater than 1.\n\nFirst, assume that $k \\geq 3$. We claim that $(a, b)=\\left(k^{2}-k-1, k-1\\right)$ is a solution. Indeed, we have\n\n$a b-1=a(k-1)-1=k a-a-1=k a-k^{2}+k+1-1=k a-k^{2}+k=k(a-k+1)=k(a-b)$.\n\nWe have already seen that this immediately implies that $\\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)=1$. We still need to check that $a$ and $b$ are positive and that they are not equal. Since $k \\geq 3$, we have $b=k-1 \\geq 2$ and $a=k^{2}-k-1 \\geq 2 k-k-1=k-1 \\geq 2$, so they are both positive. Suppose that $a=b$, then $k^{2}-k-1=k-1$, or $k^{2}=2 k$, or $k=2$, a contradiction. Thus, our pair $(a, b)$ satisfies all the conditions. For every $k \\geq 3$, the equation has at least one solution $(a, b)$ with $a \\neq b$ and $\\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)=1$.\n\nNow assume that $k=1$. We claim that $(a, b)=(2,1)$ is a solution.

Furthermore, we have\n\n$$\na b-1=2-1=1=1 \\cdot(2-1)=k(a-b) .\n$$\n\nSo for $k=1$, the equation also has at least one solution $(a, b)$ with $a \\neq b$ and $\\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)=1$.\n\nFinally, assume that $k=2$. The equation becomes\n\n$$\na b-1=2(a-b) .\n$$\n\nThe right-hand side is at most $2 a-2$ because $b$ is positive and an integer, so $a b-1 \\leq 2 a-2$, hence $a b<2 a$, so $b<2$. Therefore, we must have $b=1$. The equation then becomes $a-1=2(a-1)$, which implies $a-1=0$. We then have $a=1$ and $b=1$, so $a=b$. We conclude that there are no solutions $(a, b)$ with $a \\neq b$.\n\nThus, the only $k$ for which the original equation has no positive integer solutions $(m, n)$ with $m \\neq n$ is $k=2$."}

The game involves pairing numbers, summing them, and replacing each pair with the greatest prime divisor of the sum. The process continues until only one number remains.\n\n1. **Initial Pairing and Summing:**\n   We start with the numbers from 1 to 16. We can pair them arbitrarily and sum each pair. For example, consider the pairs:\n   \\[\n   (1, 8), (2, 15), (3, 14), (4, 13), (5, 12), (6, 11), (7, 10), (9, 16)\n   \\]\n   The sums of these pairs are:\n   \\[\n   1+8=9, \\quad 2+15=17, \\quad 3+14=17, \\quad 4+13=17, \\quad 5+12=17, \\quad 6+11=17, \\quad 7+10=17, \\quad 9+16=25\n   \\]\n\n2. **Finding the Greatest Prime Divisor:**\n   We replace each sum with its greatest prime divisor:\n   \\[\n   \\text{gpd}(9)=3, \\quad \\text{gpd}(17)=17, \\quad \\text{gpd}(17)=17, \\quad \\text{gpd}(17)=17, \\quad \\text{gpd}(17)=17, \\quad \\text{gpd}(17)=17, \\quad \\text{gpd}(17)=17, \\quad \\text{gpd}(25)=5\n   \\]\n   Thus, the new set of numbers is:\n   \\[\n   3, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 5\n   \\]\n\n3. **Second Pairing and Summing:**\n   We pair these numbers again:\n   \\[\n   (3, 17), (5, 17), (17, 17), (17, 17)\n   \\]\n   The sums are:\n   \\[\n   3+17=20, \\quad 5+17=22, \\quad 17+17=34, \\quad 17+17=34\n   \\]\n\n4. **Finding the Greatest Prime Divisor:**\n   We replace each sum with its greatest prime divisor:\n   \\[\n   \\text{gpd}(20)=5, \\quad \\text{gpd}(22)=11, \\quad \\text{gpd}(34)=17, \\quad \\text{gpd}(34)=17\n   \\]\n   Thus, the new set of numbers is:\n   \\[\n   5, 11, 17, 17\n   \\]\n\n5. **Third Pairing and Summing:**\n   We pair these numbers again:\n   \\[\n   (5, 11), (17, 17)\n   \\]\n   The sums are:\n   \\[\n   5+11=16, \\quad 17+17=34\n   \\]\n\n6. **Finding the Greatest Prime Divisor:**\n   We replace each sum with its greatest prime divisor:\n   \\[\n   \\text{gpd}(16)=2, \\quad \\text{gpd}(34)=17\n   \\]\n   Thus, the new set of numbers is:\n   \\[\n   2, 17\n   \\]\n\n7. **Final Pairing and Summing:**\n   We pair these numbers:\n   \\[\n   (2, 17)\n   \\]\n   The sum is:\n   \\[\n   2+17=19\n   \\]\n\n8. **Finding the Greatest Prime Divisor:**\n   We replace the sum with its greatest prime divisor:\n   \\[\n   \\text{gpd}(19)=19\n   \\]\n\nThus, the maximum number that can be obtained at the end of the game is 19.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{19}$."}
